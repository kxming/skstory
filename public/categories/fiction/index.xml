        <description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*DQtPiFsZ8kYwJ18roQEayQ.png" alt="Featured image of post Data Era" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core value that defines a person is privacy unknown to others. As usual, Mako wakes up to a series of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your body temperature is 36 degrees Celsius, blood pressure 112/73 millimeters of mercury, in a good health state. Last night you slept for 7 hours and 19 minutes, of which deep sleep lasted for……&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This voice &amp;lsquo;grew&amp;rsquo; out of her brain. With the maturity of brain-computer interface technology, the electronic secretary created a voice that only one person could &amp;lsquo;hear&amp;rsquo; by stimulating the cortical area of the temporal lobe to simulate auditory impulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What time is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s 9:55 am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh no! There&amp;rsquo;s a lecture by Masakazu Yoshida today! …What time does it start?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It starts at 10:20 am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then I must hurry!&amp;rdquo; Mako swiftly threw off the covers, the cold air flooding into her brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You won&amp;rsquo;t make it, you can&amp;rsquo;t enter after the lecture starts. Even if you hurry now, grooming and travel time will take 35 minutes, you&amp;rsquo;ll arrive at 10:30 am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t understand! It&amp;rsquo;s such a stroke of luck to get a ticket to his lecture! If I hurry now… If I move a bit faster on the road, maybe I could still catch it…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s impossible. Based on previous data and your current indicators, it&amp;rsquo;s calculated that you need 15 minutes to get ready and leave, and the planned route from home to school takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the earliest you can be at the school auditorium is 10:30 am, and this is accurate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does a machine know? I cannot afford to be late this time!&amp;rdquo; Mako muttered while brushing her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this moment, a smiling face appeared on the mirror of the sink, and the voice of the electronic secretary sounded again: &amp;ldquo;Firstly, the fastest you can arrive at the school auditorium is at 10:30 am, this is the result considering all parameters, there is no possibility of arriving earlier. Secondly, I would like to remind you that I am not just a computer, I am the full data service system developed by the Umbrella Corporation. Although I communicate with you by releasing sound signals through the brain-computer interface, in reality, I can network with every item in your life that contains an Umbrella chip, collect all the data you generate within a day, connect personal data with society databases, thus providing the most comprehensive life services. Our vision at Umbrella is to optimize life and serve the society. Our values are…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako stopped paying attention to the electronic secretary. In the series of coherent actions that followed, she didn&amp;rsquo;t waste any time - the door automatically unlocked after recognizing her fingerprint; she ran to the elevator just as the doors opened; she took the elevator to the first floor, exited the apartment and a car stopped just in front of her, at the moment she seated herself sideways, the vehicle started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between leaving home and getting in the car, not even a second of spare time was left in each step of Mako&amp;rsquo;s journey because the electronic secretary pulled information from the cloud database, and after considering residential elevator usage and city traffic, it sent precise operational commands to the Umbrella chips embedded in the elevator and the car. The entire commute planning system was like precisely meshed gears, filled with an aesthetic of uniformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako&amp;rsquo;s car had no driver, and she was silently accelerated to 240 kilometers an hour. Looking out the window, the ring road was full of cars, speeding vehicles maintaining a mere 20 centimeters apart. Such a high speed and proximity between the cars turned this stream of vehicles into a real liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This liquid could breathe. If a car needed to change lanes or turn, from afar to nearby, dozens of surrounding vehicles would gradually make space for it, clearing the way, like a well-drained Roman triplex formation, without the need for a commander&amp;rsquo;s coordination, as each soldier in the formation knew what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing by a vast advertising slogan: &amp;ldquo;Smart City - A city with a heartbeat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before the school auditorium came into view. Mako hurried out of the car and stepped onto the first step in front of the auditorium, looking up at the huge electronic clock overhead, it was 10:29 am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two seconds later, the numbers flickered gently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:30 am, right on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to being late, Mako could not enter the auditorium, so she had to ask a fellow student from the school office to find her a seat backstage. Even so, she could feel the lively atmosphere of the venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In conclusion, I would like to say to the youth present, you are lucky to be living in this well-ordered era! Humanity is experiencing stability and convenience like never before. This is the fruit of your parents&amp;rsquo; struggles and contributions, and it&amp;rsquo;s also the mission that you all continue to carry on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the speaker&amp;rsquo;s voice faded, thunderous applause filled the auditorium. Without a doubt, the lecture was a success, and the school office staff finally breathed a sigh of relief - not even halfway through the year, and three students had already jumped off the dormitory roof to their deaths. Over the past decade, suicide rates, shootings, alcohol abuse, and drug cases in universities worldwide have been slowly rising. There were various speculations, but no consensus. Masakazu Yoshida is elegant and understated, rarely participating in public lectures. This time the school office went to great lengths to invite him to give a motivational talk in an attempt to reverse the growing sense of despondency among college students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host took over the microphone: &amp;ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Yoshida, for your inspiring lecture. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the Q&amp;amp;A session, the direction of questions is not limited. The student there… wearing a blue jacket and glasses, I see you were the first to raise your hand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, Mr. Yoshida. You just said that we live in an orderly era… I believe you are referring to the era of full data. As a creator of the new era, could you share with us your most direct feelings about the changes in times? What has been the biggest change?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After listening, Masakazu Yoshida pondered for a moment: &amp;ldquo;If I had to describe the past era with one word, I would choose &amp;lsquo;chaos.&amp;rsquo; The world has changed rapidly in these years, and you can&amp;rsquo;t imagine the world of my childhood because you didn&amp;rsquo;t experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the past, it took over two and a half hours just to travel from the south to the north of the city due to poor traffic and congestion; and when someone fell seriously ill, they had to queue at the hospital for a famous doctor. If one doctor did not succeed, they would have to queue for another at a different hospital. Many people delay their treatment like this. There were also fraudsters everywhere - financial scams, telecommunications fraud, internet scams… Every day countless frauds took away people&amp;rsquo;s life savings, and then the scammers vanished without a trace, and the police were powerless against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the world before the era of full data, this was the chaos people faced. As the name suggests, the era of full data means that the data generated by everyone every day is collected and uploaded to a central database. Using these data and results derived from data processing, we can provide people with better lives. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t accomplished overnight; countless engineers and scientists have contributed their wisdom to the advent of the age of full data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At the beginning of the 21st century, IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) was the first to apply big data technology to medicine. They developed IBM Watson, a cognitive computing system that can read through thousands of medical journals within minutes, compare massive cases in the database, and find the best treatment plan. As a result, big data medicine became popular, and humanity gradually moved away from depending solely on doctors for diagnosis and treatment. &amp;lsquo;Famous doctors&amp;rsquo; were no longer scarce resources; cloud-based diagnosis and treatment, dependent on computer systems, opened to everyone, and were more accurate and transparent. This approach provided patients not just with time but also hope for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then, there was the autonomous driving field. Originally, the technology barrier for autonomous driving was very high due to the many random events on the roads. Before, we hoped cars could respond to emergencies in an instant by equipping each one with a sensitive LiDAR and a central system that could react quickly. However, this also meant high costs and the possibility of errors. Looking at the autonomous cars mass-produced and used today, they don&amp;rsquo;t have radars at all, and their control systems use chips at the personal computer level. This is because Google changed the research approach - though developing an autonomous car is difficult, if the entire city&amp;rsquo;s cars are self-driven, and the traffic is treated as a whole, then it&amp;rsquo;s another matter. Connected through networks, collecting and analyzing the position and speed information of each car, the networked car technology has made each vehicle a cell in a massive organism, with higher-level commands given by the central system, so no collisions will occur. This not only solves safety issues but also the cloud database contains the position and routes of all vehicles in the city, as well as reading the vehicles&amp;rsquo; historical records, each person&amp;rsquo;s travel habits, and driving patterns. With macro-management algorithms, the overall city&amp;rsquo;s traffic is planned, optimizing vehicle routes to maximize road utilization rate, therefore, the city is no longer plagued by congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of course, Chinese entrepreneurs and engineers did not want to lag in exploring the application of big data. With the rise of e-commerce at the beginning of the 21st century, China, a large country with billions of people, had major logistical challenges. For example, when everyone rushed to shop at the Singles Day discount, how to deliver each order to buyers as quickly as possible during an explosion of orders? The solution was simple: read all past customer data, predict the purchase situation for each merchant&amp;rsquo;s goods for the year, and then create warehouse distribution plans before the big sales. Before Singles Day arrived, sellers had already placed goods in different warehouses in South China, North China, and East China based on forecast data; logistics companies&amp;rsquo; delivery workers and vehicles were also positioned according to the predicted data. The average delivery time was reduced from a week to three days, significantly speeding up the national logistics network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In this way, big data applications slowly permeated every corner of society: elevator systems collected residents&amp;rsquo; work schedules to optimize the operation and reduce waiting time; analyzing individual search terms and video viewing types to project user interests and preferences then deliver precise ads; smart toilets daily monitored excrement, recording personal health conditions, serving as part-time personal doctors, and could also provide the government with epidemic warnings…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To summarize - accurate data records of individuals can improve personal lives; massive data records of groups can optimize resource allocation. We have &amp;lsquo;calculated&amp;rsquo; the life we want using big data technology, and in this way, we have finally bid farewell to chaos. This is the change I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed over the years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Yoshida, for taking us through the detailed review of the full data era&amp;rsquo;s inception,&amp;rdquo; the host continued, addressing the audience, &amp;ldquo;So, the next question… Okay, the student in the red sweater there, please pass the microphone to him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, Mr. Yoshida. As a university graduate about to step out of school, I am curious why you decided to enter the credit industry at that time. I have read many articles about you; back then you decisively gave up graduate admission from an Ivy League school and a high-paying offer from a top investment firm to start a new company in a niche industry. How were you considering at that time? Did you have full confidence in success?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How could there be one hundred percent confidence before starting?&amp;rdquo; Masakazu Yoshida said with a smile, pushing his glasses, and Mako saw the intelligent crow&amp;rsquo;s feet at the corner of his eyes from the screen, &amp;ldquo;But I did see the trend at that time. We all know if businesses or individuals need loans, financial institutions will carry out a credit rating on them to determine the loan amount, interest rates, and period. In the past, credit ratings were usually done by credit bureaus, analyzing past large loan records, income levels, and asset size, then rigidly adopting formulas to rate; this not only required manual statistics but also could not avoid systemic errors. In contrast, my company, Umbrella, broke down the credit process on the Internet and integrated it into the everyday work and life of borrowers. Every individual&amp;rsquo;s every purchase, every monthly credit card record, salary transfer record, and every company&amp;rsquo;s transfer records became the basis for credit assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;However, if just that, it would still not be outstanding. Umbrella innovatively incorporated concepts such as genetic testing, personality tests, academic performance, romantic history, criminal records, and performance assessments all unrelated to finance into the credit system. Many academic studies have confirmed that a person&amp;rsquo;s trustworthiness in borrowing is related to their genes, personality, intellect, and even the level of loyalty in a romantic relationship. We gather all financial and non-financial information of an individual and algorithmically generate credit ratings. Compared to traditional credit, this is a more realistic and universal rating, which not only better reflects financial risks but is also applicable to other non-financial settings; it can be said to be versatile.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For instance…can it be used for dating?&amp;rdquo; asked the student in the red sweater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Haha…as expected of young people, always concerned about love. Yes, before a girl accepts your proposal, she can check your dating credit record. If you have a history of infidelity or if all your ex-partners think you&amp;rsquo;re inconsiderate, then of course she will friend-zone you. Besides that, school admissions, company hiring, and business cooperation can all make use of this comprehensive credit system. Umbrella achieved a unified credit system in human society for the first time. From then on, every individual and every company has to be responsible for every decision they make, this is epoch-making for the advancement of societal civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;However, the premise of the full data credit is the enormous task of data collection a single enterprise cannot complete it alone. Therefore, I proposed the political sphere, and with the government&amp;rsquo;s encouragement, the International Data Cooperation Act was passed at the United Nations headquarters. The act consists of a preamble and 26 articles, establishing 4 basic principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairness: All data generated by everyone&amp;rsquo;s daily actions will be collected, regardless of profession and background;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing: After an individual&amp;rsquo;s data is collected, it will be shared to a cloud database, available for use by all enterprises and institutions worldwide;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy: Personal data must be encrypted before it can be analyzed, and no enterprise or individual has the right to access targeted personal data. All terminal devices, including electronic secretaries, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent electronic devices, only receive the results of issued commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom: Individuals may purchase their data for a specific period to prevent it from being collected and stored, as long as it does not contravene laws or the interests of others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host then said: &amp;ldquo;The milestone significance of the International Data Cooperation Act is self-evident! After its inception, the world has become transparent, we precisely describe and serve every individual with data, use it to improve living standards, and even predict future black swan events to prevent them. The stable and harmonious era of full data has finally arrived.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masakazu Yoshida nodded slightly in agreement: &amp;ldquo;I think, my achievement is not so much in creating a large enterprise, but in promoting society into the full data era. Umbrella&amp;rsquo;s chips, developed by our company, are embedded in necessary items like refrigerators, shoe soles, rice cookers, lights, etc., to collect the data generated at every moment. They are also interconnected through the internet, continuously providing us with the most targeted services. This is probably why I was invited today to return to my alma mater to give this lecture… I hope everyone is satisfied with this answer. So, what&amp;rsquo;s the next question?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Q&amp;amp;A session on stage was still underway, Mako&amp;rsquo;s attention was drawn to a shadow in the backstage area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was standing in the corridor next to the backstage makeup room when a figure in a black hoodie tiptoed into Huang Zhaojing&amp;rsquo;s makeup room. Mako glanced inside through the door gap; there was no one else in the room, and the shadow was rummaging in front of a man&amp;rsquo;s jacket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had stumbled upon a thief. She hurried into the makeup room and demanded: &amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow paused, then replied: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t make a sound.&amp;rdquo; Shortly thereafter, they pulled a flat accessory the size of an eraser from Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s jacket pocket. The brim of the thief&amp;rsquo;s hat was pressed so low that their entire face was shrouded in shadow. A hand swiftly reached out from the shadows, grabbed Mako&amp;rsquo;s wrist, and despite her resistance, dragged her outside and into a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, she heard the noise accompanied by the school office staff&amp;rsquo;s shouting from backstage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s going on?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t we have a record check for students before they entered?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quick, get control of him first!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned to the shadow: &amp;ldquo;What did you just take?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While starting the car, the shadow replied succinctly: &amp;ldquo;Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s mobile database, which is also evidence of his unauthorized intrusion into the public database.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car left the school gate, and the figure finally pulled down their hood, revealing themselves as Mako&amp;rsquo;s classmate from the mathematics department, Lin Youjie. Seeing a familiar face from campus, Mako relaxed a bit. Although they hadn&amp;rsquo;t interacted before, she had heard of him. Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s reputation was tied to key phrases like &amp;ldquo;rich second generation,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;math genius,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;eccentric behavior.&amp;rdquo; While she contemplated ways to escape, she realized her Umbrella chip was voice-controlled. How could she discreetly send a location signal to the cloud without Lin Youjie noticing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you Lin Youjie? From the math department, right? …What exactly do you want?!&amp;rdquo; she demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quite a few questions… Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m Lin Youjie, from the math department. I&amp;rsquo;ll answer your third question later. Tell me your name first.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My name is Mako…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin Youjie connected the mobile accessory he had stolen from Masakazu Yoshida to his mobile computer, and the pre-set program started running automatically. The silence in the car was awkward. Mako noticed that she had no signal on her mobile phone, and whispering to her electronic secretary elicited no response. She looked up in a panic, only to receive an expected response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t bother trying. I&amp;rsquo;ve blocked your phone and electronic secretary. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased the data trajectory for the next 100 hours for both of us. During this time, none of the information you generate will be uploaded to the cloud.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He purchased the data trajectory for 100 hours. Mako was shocked. Although the International Data Cooperation Act clearly stated that paying a certain fee could preserve one&amp;rsquo;s data from being recorded in the cloud, the cost for this privilege has remained prohibitively expensive over the years. Complete data isolation for one-hour costs about the weekly salary of an average office worker. When &amp;ldquo;connection to everything&amp;rdquo; had become the trend of the age, &amp;ldquo;disconnection and isolation&amp;rdquo; had turned into a costly luxury. Growing up in an ordinary salaried family, Mako had only experienced privacy isolation for two and a half hours last year when attending a wealthy friend&amp;rsquo;s birthday party, thanks to her friend&amp;rsquo;s father. She never understood the rich&amp;rsquo;s obsession with their privacy - why fear others knowing if you&amp;rsquo;re not doing anything wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, being granted a hundred hours of privacy isolation out of the blue, she was utterly baffled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain started to fall outside, pouring onto the windshield as the wipers swung back and forth, trying to clear a view through the veil of rain. Lin Youjie focused on this window, hands on the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then did Mako realize that the car they were in was equipped with a manual driving system!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This car… is manually driven?!&amp;rdquo; she exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s an old model. Want to listen to some music? There&amp;rsquo;s a CD in the compartment on your left, just slide it into the player,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shook her head: &amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know how to use that player. Where are you taking me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin Youjie kept his eyes on the road and didn&amp;rsquo;t answer her. He single-handedly opened the compartment and put the CD into the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako was perplexed by how Lin Youjie managed to drive a car at 240 kilometers per hour, weaving through the rhythmic, uniform traffic of autonomous vehicles, finding every gap, dodging in and out, all while being able to put music on. He was like the most jarring noise in a piano piece, with the gray downpour assaulting them upfront, water splashing high into the air from the tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re driving dangerously,&amp;rdquo; she said, her palms sweating from nervousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, the cars around us controlled by algorithms each have a predetermined trajectory. Understanding the pattern makes it safe. Besides… I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to kidnap you, there was no other way, I need to ask for your help.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s what all kidnappers say to their victims. What exactly did you do in the auditorium? I&amp;rsquo;m not stupid; if you had done nothing wrong, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been keen on driving off with me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin Youjie did not drive far. After circling the school a few times, he stopped at the coffee shop near the school gate. He motioned for Mako to get out, and they sat down at a table. After ordering drinks, Lin Youjie paid for them with some cash and picked up a book from the shelf, flipping through it while he said to Mako:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like this coffee shop because they still have these paper books.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not many people read paper books nowadays. All my books are in electronic format.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So… What kind of books do you like?&amp;rdquo; Lin Youjie shifted his gaze from the pages to Mako&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The recently popular &amp;lsquo;Time Travel in the Deep Palace: The Eighth Princes Love Me&amp;rsquo; is fantastic! There&amp;rsquo;s also &amp;lsquo;The Heiress&amp;rsquo;s Three Lifetimes 2&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Revenge of the Secret Agent Crown Princess.&amp;rsquo; They have very romantic love stories, and the male leads are both handsome and charming. These few books have practically monopolized the market, their advertisements are everywhere… And their intellectual property has been purchased, soon to be adapted on the big screen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I tell you that I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of these books, would you believe me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Impossible, they&amp;rsquo;re trendy among young people!&amp;rdquo; Mako hesitantly replied, &amp;ldquo;Many of my classmates are reading them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Vulgar literary works always attract attention, but once you&amp;rsquo;ve read a few similar e-books, Umbrella will classify you as an audience for mindless films. Your computer, phone, and any smart billboards you see will push similar content to you according to your &amp;rsquo;taste,&amp;rsquo; and then without realizing it, you become engrossed in cultural junk. Millions of young people are just like you. This feedback is sent back to publishing houses and film production companies, resulting in more and more vulgar books and TV shows being produced. Soon, the cultural market will be inundated with trash. So - extensive real-time data feedback can create this information black box, leading to monotony and ignorance. I&amp;rsquo;ve never allowed them to extract my data, so of course, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be poisoned by such books.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako sneered dismissively: &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s so great about that?… It&amp;rsquo;s just a book to relax with, no need to make a big deal out of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I tell you that in addition to books and movies, news, knowledge, information, and even your career and life choices have been stuffed into a predictable black box and that Masakazu Yoshida and his Umbrella company are going to be the culprits behind the decay of human society, would you believe that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako looked at Lin Youjie in confusion, taking a moment to respond: &amp;ldquo;…So you&amp;rsquo;re an anti-full-data individual! I noticed earlier; that you&amp;rsquo;re manually driving, you&amp;rsquo;re paying with cash, you&amp;rsquo;re reading physical books - all to avoid leaving a digital trail. I heard in the news that your conservative faction is on the rise. But forgive my frankness, every technological revolution comes with opposition. You&amp;rsquo;re like the Luddites of the 19th century who went around destroying looms. Could they stop the Industrial Revolution? A few looms to an entire era are like grains of sand. Your voice in the full data era is less than even a grain of sand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin Youjie shook his head helplessly as a waiter brought over a cup of coffee, which Lin Youjie gently slid towards Mako: &amp;ldquo;Here, an espresso, I ordered it for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako brightened slightly at the sight of the coffee: &amp;ldquo;Hmm, thank you. I was wanting this…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your phone alarm has your routine, indicating you&amp;rsquo;re an early riser and nap-taker; your smart toilet detected your blood sugar levels; your fitness tracker has recorded your heartbeat and temperature; your digital wallet indicated that you had a filling breakfast this morning and you habitually drink espresso to stay alert. Therefore, by analyzing your physical indicators, it can be concluded: that you&amp;rsquo;re feeling sleepy right now and could use a cup of coffee to wake up… Does this cup of coffee meet your expectations?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes… But how were you able to access targeted personal information? According to the International Data Cooperation Act, personal data must be encrypted before being used for algorithmic analysis; no enterprise or individual has the right to access targeted personal data. Are you saying… you hacked into the cloud database?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Mako&amp;rsquo;s questioning, Lin Youjie remained noncommittal: &amp;ldquo;Every day, there are about 130 people with a reliance on caffeine, just like you, who come to this place for an espresso. With this data, the cafe can adjust inventory and staffing, preparing enough raw materials in advance; IBS (location-based services) have their macro analyses - most students who come here for coffee sit all day. So many students congregating here indicates business opportunities. Hence, bubble tea shops, copy centers, and reading rooms have opened up around, each with significant customer traffic and profit. Students found a study spot, staff earned wages, shops made profits, the school collected rent, the neighborhood became more commercially valuable, and you, Miss Mako, were no longer sleepy this afternoon thanks to a cup of coffee. In this case, full data ensures the most optimal resource allocation and benefits everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako nodded, looking at Lin Youjie with confusion. &amp;ldquo;So, why are you opposing the full data era then? Why do you oppose Masakazu Yoshida?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because we&amp;rsquo;ll never know if Masakazu Yoshida wants to drink coffee. There&amp;rsquo;s an issue with the &amp;lsquo;Principle of Freedom&amp;rsquo; in the International Data Cooperation Act. Those at the top of the Forbes list can, of course, afford to prevent access to all their personal and family data at any time. But what about the average person? The salaryman? The family of five living in a 40-square-meter space? Privacy? They probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t buy such an intangible thing, would they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So what? I am that average person. So what if all my data is uploaded? I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt any inconvenience…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin Youjie cut her off: &amp;ldquo;Mako, have you ever considered what determines why some people reach the top of the pyramid while others live paycheck to paycheck every day?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako was taken aback, not expecting such a clichéd question, and said hesitantly, &amp;ldquo;…Successful people are 99% hard work and 1% genius?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you believe that? We got into top universities, aren&amp;rsquo;t we all Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s juniors? Aren&amp;rsquo;t we diligent? Aren&amp;rsquo;t we talented? Yet after we graduate, 99% of us lead mediocre lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, the proportion wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly this high during Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you think all this is caused by the Umbrella company?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s caused by the full data era,&amp;rdquo; Lin Youjie corrected, &amp;ldquo;Today, computers can replace most of the work carried out by humans, whether it&amp;rsquo;s intellectual work or crafts, none is spared. Once algorithms are cracked, even the most talented traders can&amp;rsquo;t compete with computers; as soon as designs are read, the craftsmanship of seasoned artisans doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the precision of machines. So, what&amp;rsquo;s left of human value? - It&amp;rsquo;s the secrets not known to others, the paths once taken, people met, and experiences had, that constitute a person&amp;rsquo;s core value. The key for a person to stand out is not diligence or genius, but privacy. In this era, the difference between elites and the average, the rich and the poor, lies in who controls privacy and data.&amp;rdquo; He paused, &amp;ldquo;But most people won&amp;rsquo;t think about this anymore. Once privacy is uploaded, it means the full data era has robbed them of creativity and reflective ability… And, thanks to my father who has some money, besides buying me a car, also bought me the highest level of privacy protection. Otherwise, I would be like you all, chasing novels and TV shows, not feeling that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with this absurd era.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No wonder they didn&amp;rsquo;t detect your anti-full data tendencies in the auditorium; because all the data… it was never stored in the database at all!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not the point, extended privacy protection has given me the ability to think independently. If a person&amp;rsquo;s preferences are fully transparent, then simply by tweaking a few settings in the city&amp;rsquo;s central computer and conveying them via the electronic secretaries inserted in people&amp;rsquo;s brains, they can be guided to appear in any place, do anything… Their work experience and personal abilities are recorded in the database, replaceable by computers or others at any time, producing nothing of unique value. Thus, they can only do the lowest repetitive tasks in the city&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem, earning just enough to live. Life is like a road with an end in sight; there&amp;rsquo;s no chance and no challenge, and everyone feels the ceiling over them before even graduating, which is why the suicide rate among young people around the world is rising!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s crazy theory, Mako&amp;rsquo;s rationality returned: &amp;ldquo;These are all speculations; where is the evidence?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin Youjie pondered for a moment: &amp;ldquo;Evidence… I have it. Did you just ask me if I hacked into the cloud database? You give me too much credit. Such databases are maintained year-round by top cybersecurity experts; even with exceptional skills, it would be difficult to find a vulnerability.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then how did you obtain my data? All service endpoints, whether it&amp;rsquo;s electronic secretaries or others, should receive only the outcomes of cloud data computation; the intermediate process should be a black box!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The mobile hard drive that I just mentioned contains all the updated data from Masakazu Yoshida every day. I used it to forge his identity, and after the cloud database recognized it, I was able to retrieve your information.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The thing you stole backstage just now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin Youjie nodded: &amp;ldquo;Masakazu Yoshida bought off his data, blocking all of his data from the cloud database, but he also wanted to understand the status of his health, assets, and company operations. How to securely collect the data continuously generated by oneself for personal use? The solution is simple - all data generated by Masakazu Yoshida is collected at the terminal into that small box, existing independently from the outside world in the most primitive form of isolation for data security. But it is also the most unsafe. I only need to steal its physical form… there will be no alarms, and no possibility to remotely format it after it&amp;rsquo;s discovered to be stolen… As long as I have it, I firmly hold Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s secrets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How ironic… In an era where information security is highly emphasized, the theft of top secrets is actually through such a crude method.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lin Youjie nodded: &amp;ldquo;If this gets out, Masakazu Yoshida will spend the rest of his life in prison. Not only that but with this evidence, a comprehensive investigation into Umbrella can be initiated by the government. Once the government&amp;rsquo;s experts analyze a sufficient number of samples, they can also prove that the entire data collection and analysis system is detrimental to human society. It&amp;rsquo;s just… I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I need your help with this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because there&amp;rsquo;s no time. The moment my face appeared backstage, they would have pinpointed my identity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What should I do now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Finish your espresso. Then, go to my car - a manually driven car is detached from the database. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, they won&amp;rsquo;t find you that quickly - use the notebook in the car with this small black box to access the cloud database. Download the useful information and distribute it to five different media outlets, with the list all on the computer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And then?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;…You might also want to look at your data in the cloud database, it could be quite interesting!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood up and walked out of the coffee shop&amp;rsquo;s door, and his elongated silhouette in the sunshine looked like a straight exclamation mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Mako snapped back to reality and raced to the door of the coffee shop, Lin Youjie had vanished, leaving only the manually driven car behind. &amp;ldquo;If &amp;lsquo;being connected to everything&amp;rsquo; has become inevitable, then &amp;lsquo;disconnecting from the system&amp;rsquo; has become the most fragile luxury…&amp;rdquo; she murmured to herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako entered Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s car and took the computer before anyone could discover her. However, as she walked home with the computer in her arms, a terrifying silence descended upon her. Only an hour had gone by since she had disconnected, and she still had a long time to go before the 100-hour privacy break ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobile phone signal was back, but it lacked functionalities like advertisement push and travel planning, now just a bare communication tool, much quieter. There was no telling voice guiding her when to turn left at an intersection, nor did the red traffic lights turn green for her. She had never been caught in the rain before, because her electronic secretary would have planned her itinerary based on weather predictions to avoid her exposure to rain, but today she became a drenched chicken, a lost one at that on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet she felt a thrill, with no electronic secretary&amp;rsquo;s nagging reminders, she learned to be alone for the first time and to listen to her thoughts. For the first time, her life was completely her own; her secrets belonged to her, not to be meddled with by others. But what when the rain stops? When the 100 hours are over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she have to return to the predetermined track? When she got home, she opened the portable computer, impersonating Masakazu Yoshida, and logged into the page where all her data was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s the fascination in this? Just a bunch of boring numbers,&amp;rdquo; she said to herself, recalling Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s words. Then an idea flashed through her mind; she checked the computer&amp;rsquo;s hidden folders and found a complex algorithm Lin Youjie had left behind. Subconsciously, she uploaded all her data to the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An image appeared on the screen - it was Mako herself but aged by ten years. She immediately realized this was a simulation of her future based on past data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene was set in a villa. She was dressed elegantly, enjoying afternoon tea with a few equally well-dressed ladies, holding bone china cups. Her obedient son and daughter sat by her side, the daughter&amp;rsquo;s eyes like hers, the son&amp;rsquo;s nose like hers. The afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a soft, surreal glow on the house and its occupants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is your future, Miss Mako,&amp;rdquo; a line of text appeared on the computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;…Not bad. But it&amp;rsquo;s not interesting to know the future so early!&amp;rdquo; She opened her email to attach the data package containing Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s evidence. Just as she was about to click &amp;lsquo;send email,&amp;rsquo; the villa door on the screen was gently pushed open, and a man stood outside. Only the hand that pushed the door, with a wedding ring, was visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you want to see who your future husband is?&amp;rdquo; the computer prompted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never mind, I guess I&amp;rsquo;m not destined to meet him anyway.&amp;rdquo; Mako clicked the &amp;lsquo;send&amp;rsquo; button, and the data recording her actions updated swiftly with a few lines. The beautiful future scene on the screen vanished instantly, replaced by a long silence and a black screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Goodbye, full data era,&amp;rdquo; Mako mumbled to herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Notice of the Dismissal of Masakazu Yoshida as Chairman&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;During Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s tenure as CEO of Umbrella (August 2028 - November 2039), he illegally penetrated the international cloud database and accessed others&amp;rsquo;s information, severely violating the International Data Cooperation Act and adversely affecting the company&amp;rsquo;s image. Now Masakazu Yoshida has been subjected to a court subpoena, and Umbrella will fully cooperate with the related investigations. At the same time, to minimize the impact of this incident on public life, the board of directors has decided, effective immediately, to relieve Masakazu Yoshida of his duties as CEO of Umbrella, with the former Chief Technology Officer taking over the company&amp;rsquo;s operational affairs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mako did not anticipate Umbrella&amp;rsquo;s swift response; they reacted just hours after the news release. Mako continued to scroll down with her mouse but noticed that besides the punishment of Masakazu Yoshida individually, there was no mention of a government investigation into Umbrella&amp;rsquo;s data processing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accompanying image in the notice on the website was a photo with a caption noting &amp;ldquo;former CEO of Umbrella cooperates with the investigation.&amp;rdquo; Although the man was wearing the same style suit, and the same glasses, a closer inspection by Mako revealed that he was not Masakazu Yoshida at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How is this possible…&amp;rdquo; she murmured, &amp;ldquo;This person is not Masakazu Yoshida, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen his face.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She immediately went online to search for images of Masakazu Yoshida, and all the official photos of him were different from what she remembered. If Mako had never seen Lin Youjie, perhaps she would have doubted her memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Damn it…&amp;rdquo; She quickly sent a video call to Lin Youjie; after the news had come out, he should have been out of danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her phone screen lit up, and greeting her was a man in a black hoodie, the same warmth, the same handsome look. Except - it was a completely unfamiliar face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She broke out in a cold sweat and quickly hung up the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Mako gradually understood the real meaning behind Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s words - that the core value of a person is those unknown privacies. Once all data is extracted, a persona can be painted, machines can mimic all their behaviors, access all their accounts, and simulate a possible future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, does it matter who is who, whether their physical bodies exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masakazu Yoshida may have never existed, just an image tool presented by Umbrella for PR purposes, or maybe he did exist once, but could easily be made a scapegoat and vanish into a wisp of history. And so could she. If a mathematics student who drives a manual car, doesn&amp;rsquo;t read e-books and only pays with cash can be defined as Lin Youjie, then a girl who reads romantic novels and is late for seminars can be defined as Mako.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how she will be replaced by whom and in what way in the tide of the full data era, it remains unknown. An electronic secretary could control her whereabouts in any manner and guide her to live or die because she is transparent, yet she knows nothing on the other end of the scale. She used to think that data was a tool for convenience, after meeting Lin Youjie she thought data was a shortcut for some people, but now she finally understood that data itself is power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she no longer had the chance to tell anyone these realizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the 100 hours of privacy coverage had passed, the voice of the electronic secretary rose in her mind: &amp;ldquo;Hello, Miss Mako, we meet again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, Mako felt truly alone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 18:52:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/virtual-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UnijjfZ4pT5tdvnIcL47DQ.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Virtual Life" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kev was driving on the road with his wife and child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the three were happily chatting, an accident happened with a large truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violent impact made Kev lose consciousness instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr. Kev, your virtual life experience ends here, you lived 38 years, we look forward to your experience of the next life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dad, our teacher posed a riddle during class today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What riddle?&amp;rdquo; Kev, gripping the steering wheel, smiled and glanced at his laughing son Ian in the rearview mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What in the world is the longest yet shortest, the fastest yet slowest, the most divisible yet most extensive, and the most often overlooked yet most regrettable?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev considered this for a moment, then said, &amp;ldquo;Dad can&amp;rsquo;t figure it out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mum, can you guess?&amp;rdquo; Ian turned his wide eyes towards his mother Carla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mom doesn&amp;rsquo;t know either.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hehe, it&amp;rsquo;s time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My son is so clever.&amp;rdquo; Kev, turning his head to praise his son, heard a sudden outcry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kev! Watch out!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously with his wife&amp;rsquo;s shout, Kev looked ahead only to see a roaring truck heading straight for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time seemed to slow down at that moment. Even the transmission of sound became sluggish. Kev could see the head of the truck deforming due to the collision and the horrified expression of the truck driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after, the windshield shattered. Countless glass shards rushed towards Kev and his family. Kev instinctively threw himself in front of his wife and son, but it was of no avail. The sensation of weightlessness soon followed. It was as if the car was in a tumble dryer, tossing Kev around the corners of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev knew that the car was flipping in the air. His mind was blank. With a few violent impacts, Kev finally lost consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev slowly opened his eyes and came close to a shiny metal plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where am I?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev tried to move his limbs but found he was enclosed in a metal box. With the memory of the accident flashing back, a word suddenly came to his mind - coffin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Am I… Am I in a coffin?&amp;rdquo; wondered Kev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the metal plate was lifted, and Kev was hit with a blinding light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr. Davis, are you alright?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev listened to the stranger in a suit, his mind recalling fragments of the scene before the accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What about my wife and son? How are they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man in the suit seemed taken aback for a moment, and then responded, &amp;ldquo;You mean Carla and Ian?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, where are they?&amp;rdquo; Kev asked anxiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, they are virtual characters in your deep learning session, what you might call intelligent AI.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev processed the man&amp;rsquo;s words slowly, trying to reconcile the shattered pieces of his memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the doctors behind the man in the suit spoke up: &amp;ldquo;Mr. Davis, this time your consciousness deep learning virtual life length was 38 years, from birth to death. Mr. Davis, this time your consciousness deep learning simulation lasted for 38 years. The ending of your virtual life was considerable; a car accident due to distracted driving resulted in your death. We trust you should have a deep impression of traffic rules in your head now, as a result. Always remember to obey traffic rules in real life because you only get one life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev was left sitting alone in the cabin, the reality of his situation sinking in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning consciousness, virtual life, reality…&amp;quot; These series of words were constantly stimulating the memory in Kev&amp;rsquo;s mind until all the memories were strung together into a thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I remember…&amp;rdquo; Kev&amp;rsquo;s expression began to calm down: &amp;ldquo;The doctor just told me my virtual life lasted for thirty-eight years. But wasn&amp;rsquo;t it stated in the contract that it guarantees a forty-year life experience? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you be refunding the money for the two missing years?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr. Kev,&amp;rdquo; the man in the suit said as he pulled out the contract as if he had anticipated Kev&amp;rsquo;s question, &amp;ldquo;The contract clearly states that if death is due to force majeure, we will compensate. However, if it results from personal behavior, you will have to deal with the consequences. Running a red light that caused an accident falls under your behavior. Therefore, our company reserves the right not to compensate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev initially wanted to argue with the man in the suit. Seeing his prepared demeanor and because the two missing years of his virtual life experience might not have significant learnings, he reluctantly backed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev left the cabin and checked the time on his watch. Only ten minutes had passed since he had entered the cabin for deep learning. This was the advantage of deep learning consciousness - needing just a dozen minutes to experience decades&amp;rsquo; worth of time in a virtual conscious world. During this virtual period, consciousness would learn different knowledge and experience different aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking around, Kev saw similar cabins dotted across the entire hall. There was a multitude of such deep learning halls in the city, yet despite their number, they were still insufficient to cater to the turnout of people eager to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From when did learning require just resources and no effort? People from the past fantasized about such a possibility, and now in the present, traditional ways of learning have become meaningless. Everyone had to keep up with the trend by joining the rat race and finding better jobs or else being left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to prevent virtual life from corrupting people&amp;rsquo;s consciousness, causing mental disturbances, and blurring the lines between virtual and reality, the device defaulted to blocking the individual&amp;rsquo;s real-world memories. Thus, the trajectory of virtual life became arbitrary. Sometimes, those with less favorable luck would have to undergo deep learning multiple times to gain the desired skills or knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the cycle for everyone was earning money from learning, using the knowledge to make more money, and using more money to acquire more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev was no exception. His short ten-minute learning experience had depleted more than half of his savings and had even accrued him a significant amount of debt. But now, armed with the knowledge of a high-level engineer, Kev could apply for a high-paying job in any tech company. Maybe it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long for his learning expenditure to be recouped, possibly even exceeding the previous amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking through the bustling crowd, Kev began to envision a better future life. He confidently began to look for jobs on his phone. The sorrow of losing his wife and child in a car accident in his virtual life seemed to have only lasted for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all Kev wants to do is land a good job, pay off the debt, and enjoy life. Thoughts of marriage and childbirth are no longer important since he had already experienced them in his virtual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed your resume and confirmed that you do indeed possess the qualifications of a senior engineer from your deep learning experience. However, since your specialized knowledge is rather limited, our preference leans toward individuals with more versatile skills. Therefore, you do not fully meet our recruitment conditions…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev was squatting on the stairs, replaying the recruiter&amp;rsquo;s words and his professional fake smile in his mind. He looked at the many unsent resumes in his hands. He had assumed that spending so much money on gaining life experience would pave a golden road for him, but the reality turned out to be much harsher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So real life is very different from virtual life…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps during those short ten minutes when Kev was in virtual life, countless people had progressed and surpassed him. But this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the worst part. The worst part was that the only way to break out of this situation was to figure out how to go through more rounds of deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, buddy, are you here for an interview?&amp;rdquo; A tall, thin man had somehow ended up by Kev&amp;rsquo;s side and was peeping curiously at Kev&amp;rsquo;s resumes with a smirk on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; Kev was feeling annoyed and quickly covered and returned his resume to his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can tell the result was not good from your expression, am I right?&amp;rdquo; The tall, thin man sat down leisurely beside Kev with a signed job contract on his lap, &amp;ldquo;Let me guess, because of limited specialized knowledge?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev glanced at the tall, thin man. He still had an unpleasant grin on his face, and his small eyes were constantly checking Kev out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do we know each other?&amp;rdquo; Kev asked coldly, hoping to drive the man away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not. But I was once just like you, hitting a wall everywhere I went. I thought I could land a job after one round of deep learning.&amp;rdquo; The skinny man picked up the signed job contract on his lap and changed the subject, &amp;ldquo;Who would have thought I could land a job that other people work hard for so easily.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you came to flaunt, I think you&amp;rsquo;ve found the wrong person.&amp;rdquo; Kev got up, preparing to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I just thought we had a connection,&amp;rdquo; The tall, thin man pulled out a white paper from his bag, &amp;ldquo;If you want to solve your current problems, go to the address on this paper and find a person named William, you&amp;rsquo;ll thank me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev never believed in getting something for nothing, so he didn&amp;rsquo;t take the paper. The man left the paper on the step and walked away with a shake of his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the tall, thin man&amp;rsquo;s disappearing back, Kev let out a sigh of relief. His eyes caught sight of the paper on the step and driven by an inexplicable curiosity, he picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev squatted down and picked up the paper. It read &amp;ldquo;Industrial Area, Fourth Street, №223.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you want to solve your current problems…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words of the tall, thin man echoed unusually in Kev&amp;rsquo;s mind, like a persistent fly he couldn&amp;rsquo;t swat away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev looked at the white paper in his hand, hesitated, and finally made a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m heading to Industrial Area, Fourth Street, 223.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;industrial Zone - A place Kev had never set foot in. In an era when everyone can be a high-end intellectual, the industrial zone was the first to realize fully automated operation, which also made it the first place that lost the warmth of humanity. Today, only some vagrants and those who can&amp;rsquo;t see the light coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about this, Kev suddenly had some regrets. Seeing those rambled vagrants outside the window. Some walked aimlessly with distorted bodies, some crouched in wall corners shaking, as if they were all as insane as those in psychiatric hospitals. This made Kev not dare to meet their eyes, fearing that he would be pulled off the bus and robbed of all his possessions the next second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Young man, if I may ask, what are you doing here?&amp;rdquo; The driver asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m looking for someone,&amp;rdquo; Kev answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Looking for someone here? Do you know what kind of people are here?&amp;rdquo; The driver looked back and said: &amp;ldquo;This place is full of people left behind by the times, all are unscrupulous men who are willing to risk their lives for money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just drive and don&amp;rsquo;t look back.&amp;rdquo; Kev patted the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat and said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, my virtual life during deep learning was a racing driver.&amp;rdquo; The driver said proudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then why are you driving a taxi here? Aren&amp;rsquo;t you participating in professional competitions?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is no longer the era of matching supply and demand. If this were in the past… especially in the early days of deep learning, I would have a chance to shine.&amp;rdquo; The driver patted the steering wheel and said: &amp;ldquo;But now it&amp;rsquo;s not possible, if I want to enter professional racing, in addition to being a capable driver, I also need to have a lot of other skills in repair and business. Almost one person is a whole team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In other words, people who have only experienced deep learning once, aren&amp;rsquo;t much different from these people who haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to do deep learning?&amp;rdquo; Kev said, looking at the vagrants outside the car window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a bit of difference, otherwise, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t encounter me. In this era, the vast majority of people are like me, stuck in a position that is better than a vagrant but not as good as an outstanding elite, and can only do some ordinary jobs…&amp;rdquo; The driver stopped the car gradually as he was talking: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at №223.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the car window was an abandoned factory. Even the original factory brand had become blurry. There were many such abandoned factories in the industrial zone, all of which were historical buildings left behind by the impact of full automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you sure the address is correct?&amp;rdquo; The driver looked out the window at the dilapidated environment with some worry: &amp;ldquo;Are there people in this place?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev took out the piece of paper again and confirmed that the address was correct, then paid the driver and got out of the car. Not until Kev walked into the factory did the driver start the car to leave. Even Kev himself was a little hesitant. Are there people here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside of the factory was very spacious. The puddles everywhere on the ground made the surrounding environment very damp and cold. Perhaps only the huge safety signs on the wall still remembered the spectacular scene of a hundred people working at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev walked aimlessly toward the depths of the factory. He didn&amp;rsquo;t know where his destination was, let alone to find a man named William.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps human curiosity always coincides with the inevitable direction of events. Kev&amp;rsquo;s eyes were attracted by an inconspicuous iron door in the corner. He walked up and knocked on the door on a whim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev himself didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that a pair of eyes suddenly appear in the small window of the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can I help you?&amp;rdquo; The person inside asked, sounding very alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I… came to find William,&amp;rdquo; Kev answered tentatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you alone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; Kev nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eyes inside the door changed noticeably at the mention of the name &amp;ldquo;William&amp;rdquo;, but he still looked around carefully behind Kev&amp;rsquo;s back, apparently checking to see if there were any other people around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the small window was closed again, and then there was a series of unlocking sounds from behind the door. From the sound, there was certainly more than one lock behind the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door opened, and a man in a plaid shirt appeared in front of Kev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come in.&amp;rdquo; The man waved his hand to beckon, and after Kev entered, he quickly locked the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev sized up this William. He had a rough beard, and his hair was also greasy. His plaid shirt was very dirty, full of sweat and grease stains that had soaked in and dried out again and again. Even his slippers might break in half at any time during the &amp;ldquo;plop plop&amp;rdquo; walking process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The air inside the room was turbid. The mixed smell of fermented food and cigarettes came from the beer bottles and lunch boxes scattered around, and the cigarette butts piled up like a mountain on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you smoke?&amp;rdquo; The man pulled out a box of cigarettes and handed it to Kev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No thanks.&amp;rdquo; Kev declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev smokes in his normal life, but because the man&amp;rsquo;s living environment is unsightly, Kev subconsciously rejects the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, you are William?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man nodded, then lit a cigarette for himself and threw the box onto the table: &amp;ldquo;William is a pseudonym, but you can call me that if you want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing that William was the man&amp;rsquo;s pseudonym, Kev couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but be startled. Who uses a pseudonym in this day and age besides criminals? Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a smoker&amp;rsquo;s habit, but Kev unintentionally glanced at the cigarette box and found that it was an expensive luxury product. This detail, which didn&amp;rsquo;t match the man&amp;rsquo;s living conditions at all, made Kev more certain that what the man was doing was extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;These cigarettes are quite expensive, aren&amp;rsquo;t they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoking a cigarette, William chuckled: &amp;ldquo;This is my only hobby. By the way… how did you find me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was introduced here by a tall and thin man. He said you could solve my problem.&amp;rdquo; Kev replied, and then thought for a moment and added: &amp;ldquo;The problem of finding a job.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you know what I do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No clue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let me show you first.&amp;rdquo; William didn&amp;rsquo;t hide anything and went straight to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got up and walked towards a black plastic at the corner of the room, then gently lifted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at what was under the plastic cloth, Kev opened his eyes in surprise - it was a consciousness-deep learning machine. Although the surface of the machine was somewhat rusty, and some wires were wrapped with tape, it looked just like the machines in the learning hall overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointing at the learning machine and then at William, Kev said: &amp;ldquo;This thing…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is exactly what I do. This thing can be understood as a pirated deep learning machine.&amp;rdquo; William patted the shell of the learning machine, making a &amp;ldquo;clanging&amp;rdquo; sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where did you get this?&amp;rdquo; Kev stepped forward and carefully looked at this pirated learning machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I stole it from a scrap yard. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a simple repair. It&amp;rsquo;s almost no different from the normal learning machine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is illegal,&amp;rdquo; Kev said nervously, his voice much quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of course, I know it&amp;rsquo;s illegal, and I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one doing this.&amp;rdquo; William covered the black plastic cloth back on it, then walked back to the couch, sat down, and lit another cigarette: &amp;ldquo;So I didn&amp;rsquo;t force you to be complicit. You only need to pay a fiftieth of the regular fee to use my learning machine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev quickly calculated in his head. Based on his current savings, he could use this pirated learning machine nearly fifty times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to perform fifty deep learnings? Kev had not thought about it in detail. As far as he knew, no one in the world had performed deep learning more than ten times. Thinking about this, Kev started to doubt the authenticity of the learning machine in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Has there ever been a problem with this pirate machine?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William languidly leaned back on the couch and exhaled smoke into the air: &amp;ldquo;The machine I can guarantee you because there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been any problem so far, but there are some things to be careful about when it comes to users.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What to be careful about?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the regular learning hall, the machines all have a so-called virtual-reality isolation device, which is designed to prevent users from mixing real-world memories in the virtual life, thus causing mental and cognitive confusion. This is one of the core technologies of the learning machine, which ensures that people can repeatedly use the learning machine without burden.&amp;rdquo; William extinguished the cigarette on the table again: &amp;ldquo;But this scrapped machine does not have such a protective device. Simply put, people who use my learning machine can possess real-world memories in their virtual life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing this, Kev finally realized why he could quickly step out of the virtual life in which he had lost his wife and children due to a car accident. So, he immediately excitedly asked: &amp;ldquo;In this way, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t the course of the virtual life be dominated by the user? In other words, can the user do whatever they want in the virtual world?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmm… indeed.&amp;rdquo; William stared straight at Kev: &amp;ldquo;So, I suggest that it is best not to perform deep learning more than five times on this machine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Five times? How could such a good thing be used only five times?&amp;rdquo; Kev was very puzzled by this. He had already ignored the messy environment and sat on the chair by moving aside the beer bottles on it. At this moment, all his attention was on this learning machine that might bring him everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As I just said, there are no problems with the machine. The key is people. Without the protection of virtual-reality isolation, after many deep learning exercises, users&amp;rsquo; mental states will have various problems, big and small. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to cause any trouble because of this. Moreover, the five times I mentioned is just an approximation, some people have problems after using it once.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve used it yourself, haven&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo; Kev asked: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that you&amp;rsquo;ve used it less than five times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Me? Why would I use it?&amp;rdquo; William shrugged: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the man dealing in illegal deals. All I need is to make money off of you guys. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect to get any psychological comfort from me. Let me tell you, I tell you the risk out of goodwill. The risk is for you to bear. Moreover, others who do this kind of trade may not necessarily tell you the risk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William said, Kev was planning to find some comfort from him, to prove that there would be no problem with this learning machine, but it seemed that William was not going to give him that reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can I use it once now?&amp;rdquo; Kev thought for a moment and said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just pay the money.&amp;rdquo; William stretched lazily, rubbing his fingers in front of Kev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a word, Kev took out his wallet and handed a stack of cash to William.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving the money, William did not count it but placed it on the table casually. After smoking the last puff of the cigarette, he stood up and walked to the learning machine, clicked the control panel, and said: &amp;ldquo;The cleanliness is not as good as the regular machine. After all, all sorts of people have used it before. I hope you are okay with that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After saying this, William pulled open the metal plate of the learning machine to reveal the internal cabin of the learning machine. Inside the cabin, except for some messy wiring and occasional hints of odd smell, it was no different from the one in the learning hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev frowned and climbed into the cabin. William sorted out the wires from a spider web-like bundle and pasted them on Kev&amp;rsquo;s head and body in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cold electrodes made Kev nervous again. He swallowed his saliva and said, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re sure there&amp;rsquo;s no problem, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There won&amp;rsquo;t be any problem, rest assured.&amp;rdquo; After William said this, he covered the metal plate, leaving Kev alone inside the cabin listening to his increasingly rapid heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Three, two, one! Start!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William&amp;rsquo;s countdown reached Kev&amp;rsquo;s ears through the metal plate, and the next second, Kev felt the originally cramped cabin start to soften. The air around him seemed to be replaced by some kind of fluid. Kev wanted to leave the cabin but found himself completely powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Kev was about to suffocate, a force suddenly pulled him out of the cabin. The bright light made his eyes squint, all he could hear was laughter all around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Congratulations, it&amp;rsquo;s a boy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing this, Kev suddenly realized he had successfully entered the virtual world and began a virtual life as a newborn. If it were not for his real memories, the experience of being born from his mother wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as clear as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long time, Kev&amp;rsquo;s eyes gradually adjusted to the light. He opened his eyes and observed everything around him. Within his sight, apart from the soft quilt, a woman with a sweaty head gently looked at him - no doubt this woman was Kev&amp;rsquo;s mother in the virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Kev&amp;rsquo;s real memories only exist in the consciousness of his brain and could not manifest in the body of a newborn baby, this did not hinder Kev&amp;rsquo;s growth in the subsequent times like a child prodigy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was ten years old, Kev&amp;rsquo;s adult-like behaviors worried his parents a great deal. From their perspective, Kev was a smart child. However, that cleverness had a sense of maturity as if he had forgotten to drink Mengpo soup in his previous life. Fortunately, Kev became aware of this and made some changes. Otherwise, his virtual childhood might constantly be dealing with psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, for most of the time in his virtual life, Kev has to decipher the different reactions to daily life at various ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his twenties, Kev, who had planned to reach the pinnacle of life in the virtual world, suddenly changed his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the enactment of the past twenty-odd years of virtual life has compressed Kev, or perhaps the experiences in real life left him with nowhere to vent. Kev, in his current state, is not keen on learning all kinds of knowledge that can improve himself but decided to be a carefree whirlpool, drawing from life&amp;rsquo;s experiences that have always floated on the surface and been totally out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his thirties, amidst the strange gazes of people in his virtual life, Kev experiences the rebelliousness of youth and the indulgence of being an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just when Kev thought he could keep playing until the end of this virtual life, he had an accident during a motorcycle race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he could react, he was already flying in the air unable to differentiate between up and down, left and right. Not until his body fell heavily on the ground did he realize he had a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smell of blood filled his nose and mouth, he struggled to get up, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t have the energy to do anything but his eyeballs. This reminded him of the car accident in his previous virtual life, the pain in his body at that time was no different than the current pain, it hurt so much that his soul was torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev opened his eyes wildly and pushed open the metal plate. Unlike his reaction after waking up in a regular learning hall last time, Kev showed no panic after awakening this time, however, he was still breathing heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That was quick?&amp;rdquo; William, holding a cigarette, said with a surprised tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How long has it been?&amp;rdquo; Kev tried to calm down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying attention. I haven&amp;rsquo;t even finished a cigarette, and you&amp;rsquo;re already out.&amp;rdquo; William said, handing Kev a cigarette, &amp;ldquo;Do you want to smoke now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev silently took the cigarette, took out his lighter lit it, and took a deep breath, &amp;ldquo;I killed myself in a motorcycle race.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William was taken aback, then also lit a cigarette for himself and said, &amp;ldquo;Did you die instantly?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev squinted his eyes and countered, &amp;ldquo;Otherwise?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, you&amp;rsquo;re quite lucky.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lucky?&amp;rdquo; Kev was a little confused by William&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;ldquo;Your understanding of luck seems to be different from normal people?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William waved his hand, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s something I heard from other sellers of pirated study machines. They said a client, like you, had an accident and fell from the fifth floor in their virtual life. But the key is the man didn&amp;rsquo;t completely die, he became a vegetable, hanging by a thread and being taken care of by his family in the virtual world. He spent the rest of his ten years in the hospital. Just imagine, not being able to move at all and not knowing when you could die to come out…it&amp;rsquo;s even worse than death.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That sounds…indeed quite scary, so what happened to that person later?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William shook his head, &amp;ldquo;Who knows…our pirated ones don&amp;rsquo;t have a reality-virtuality isolation device. If it were a regular version, perhaps the client might suffer less.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That reminds me of a riddle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s hear it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you know what in the world is longest and shortest, fastest and slowest, can be divided yet is vast, is the least valued yet is the most worthy of regret?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William thought for a while and replied, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William nodded pensively, &amp;ldquo;You are quite cultured.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just something I heard.&amp;rdquo; Kev explained, &amp;ldquo;I heard this from my son in the last virtual life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright.&amp;rdquo; William chuckled, &amp;ldquo;It seems deep learning does have some use.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When can I start the second time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not going to rest a bit?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; Kev stated. After experiencing the first pirated deep learning session, he felt that he had adapted to the virtual life mixed with real memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All the same, just pay.&amp;rdquo; William continued, rubbing his fingers together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev nodded, but when he opened his wallet, he realized he had only a little cash left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Could I use a card?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brother, we are committing a crime here. Could you be a bit more serious?&amp;rdquo; William helplessly shook his head, pointed to the door, and said, &amp;ldquo;Turn left at the door, about five hundred meters away, there is an ATM.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev put his wallet away and said, &amp;ldquo;Then wait for me, I&amp;rsquo;ll be back soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William nodded, and then unlocked the layers of locks on the door, &amp;ldquo;I suggest you should withdraw more at once, looking at you, it seems like you&amp;rsquo;ll need it many times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev didn&amp;rsquo;t reply and just walked straight out the door, walked through the damp, abandoned factory, and made his way onto the main street of the industrial zone. Kev feels he&amp;rsquo;s not far from living a happy life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But withdrawing money in such a mixed-bag place like the industrial zone is undoubtedly a very dangerous behavior. Thinking about this made Kev nervous again. Luckily, the path to the ATM was quiet, with no one around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later, Kev arrived at the ATM. The ATM&amp;rsquo;s one-from-one security system relaxed the originally tense Kev a little, but he still kept looking around as he withdrew money, fearing the desperados lurking in some dark corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Kev stashed the money away and double-checked again that there was no one around the ATM, he hugged his bag and quickly ran towards the abandoned factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just then, a homeless man appeared out of nowhere at the entrance of the abandoned factory, right where Kev was standing. The homeless man sat on the ground, covered in dirt and filth, his hair was long and covered in dust. By comparison, William looked merely shabby, but this homeless man was completely filthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev and the homeless man stared at each other for more than a minute. This stare-down felt like a cheetah and a gazelle on a prairie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next second, the homeless man stood up and walked toward Kev, but his actions were not in a storm-like manner to snatch things. He approached Kev in a trance, at a leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev was startled by the homeless man&amp;rsquo;s actions, almost shouting out loud, but he eventually held out as being in such a place, shouting would only attract more predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the homeless man stopped when he was a few meters away from Kev, then pointed at the bag in Kev&amp;rsquo;s hand, and made a series of incomprehensible gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the homeless man wanted to express; he only knew that the other party must want money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is mine! You can&amp;rsquo;t take it!&amp;rdquo; Kev somehow found the courage to say this to the homeless man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homeless man became a little frantic when he heard Kev&amp;rsquo;s words, his hand gestures also became more chaotic. He spoke a few words intermittently, &amp;ldquo;Go… you can&amp;rsquo;t… horrible… don&amp;rsquo;t…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homeless man had lost his ability to speak, and at this moment, Kev was like a cornered dog, hugging his money and running towards the abandoned factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev originally thought his actions were swift, but the moment he brushed past the homeless man, Kev&amp;rsquo;s arm was grabbed by the homeless man, and the bag fell to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev wanted to pick up the bag, but the homeless man had a firm grip on him and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let go. He continued to speak incoherently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps out of fright, in the struggle, Kev kicked the homeless man in the stomach. The pain made the homeless man let go and fall to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing that the other party wasn&amp;rsquo;t that tough, Kev began punching and kicking at the homeless man. Once the homeless man couldn&amp;rsquo;t get up again, Kev finally picked up the bag that fell to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you dare to rob again, I will kill you!&amp;rdquo; Kev said angrily to the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man fell to the ground, one hand holding his stomach, and the other hand slightly raised, as if trying to grab Kev again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kev, seeing that there was nobody around, and considering that this was an industrial zone, where killing a person would hardly be noticed, kicked the homeless man in the face, finally, the man stopped moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing his coat dirtied by the homeless man, Kev didn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to take off his jacket and throw it to the side. He told himself that he would buy a more expensive coat after earning money from several more rounds of deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to William&amp;rsquo;s place, Kev put the bag of money into William&amp;rsquo;s arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here is the money for thirty times.&amp;rdquo; Kev rolled up his sleeves and spoke, his spirit was entirely different from before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William, with the bag full of money in his arms, weighed it, and then casually tossed it onto the sofa without counting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thirty times? Are you sure?&amp;rdquo; Despite asking, William had already opened the plastic sheet and began configuring the learning machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is there a problem?&amp;rdquo; Kev asked, and without waiting for a response, he lay down in the learning machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of course, no problem. The customer is king. Especially the ones who&amp;rsquo;ve paid, we put your needs first.&amp;rdquo; William laughed as he placed the electrode sheets on Kev. &amp;ldquo;But let me make it clear since the users are different, I have no idea what will happen if you use it thirty times under these circumstances.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;d be at least bearable. It&amp;rsquo;s just like what happened to your client you mentioned, lying in the virtual life for perhaps over a dozen or even several dozen years…but that&amp;rsquo;d be better than this miserable and brutal reality life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, we start now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty lifetimes in a virtual world take about an hour and a half in the real world. Weighing up the time, William couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but marvel at the magic of this machine. Just by spending one and a half hours, the man who just entered the learning machine could gain about two thousand years of life experience, but that&amp;rsquo;s if everything goes well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Knock, knock, knock …&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A knock on the door interrupted William&amp;rsquo;s thoughts, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like opening it and instead quietly waited for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Open the door! It&amp;rsquo;s me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing the person outside announce themselves, William walked slowly to open the iron door, only to see the tall thin man standing outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tall man walked into the room and immediately saw the learning machine in operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh! Is it already in use?&amp;rdquo; The tall man asked in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William locked the iron door and walked to the sofa to pick up Kevin&amp;rsquo;s bag. He took out several bundles of money and handed it to the tall man, saying, &amp;ldquo;Here … this is what you deserve. You&amp;rsquo;ve outdone yourself this time. He wanted to use it thirty times right from the start.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tall man counted the money and laughed, saying, &amp;ldquo;Aren&amp;rsquo;t you afraid someone will die?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No one&amp;rsquo;s going to die, at most he may lose his soul, becoming yet another vagabond in this industrial zone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our line of work has certainly increased the population of this industrial district.&amp;rdquo; The tall man sighed, &amp;ldquo;But on the other hand, if this guy goes mad after this, won&amp;rsquo;t I have to go find the next customer for you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that would be troublesome for you.&amp;rdquo; William spread his hands and laughed helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As long as there&amp;rsquo;s money to be made, a bit of trouble is nothing.&amp;rdquo; The tall man picked up the money and took a deep sniff, &amp;ldquo;Who could resist the smell of money?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two laughed heartily. The tall man left the room with his money after a few minutes, and William sat back on the sofa. He checked the time once more and mused to himself, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m really curious about what he&amp;rsquo;ll be like after he comes out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin could no longer remember how many times he had been born. He only remembered that he had had a few close shaves due to difficult births, but thankfully everything worked out fine each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, having lived so many lifetimes, some of his memories had begun to blur. Whenever Kevin reached adulthood, his memories would intertwine with his previous virtual lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did he arrange to go out with friends? Does he have asthma? Does he have a younger brother? Did his parents divorce? Did he confess to his crush? What did he plan to do in this life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He originally thought that thirty lifetimes would each be memorable, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that this false immortality, with only consciousness accumulating, would put such a great strain on memory storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to imagine that if he continues to live a virtual life in his current state, Kevin&amp;rsquo;s mind will certainly be thrown into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only solution Kevin could think of now was to accelerate the progression of his virtual life by constantly dying and escaping the learning machine as soon as possible while he was still relatively sober.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though he knew he was living a virtual life, everything around him looked exactly like the real world, and the experience of the five senses was no different from reality. Accepting death a dozen times or so is too difficult; No one dares to die a dozen times, and Kevin&amp;rsquo;s consciousness is not very clear now. Reality and virtuality have lost their clear boundary in his mind. Every death to him feels almost like a real death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin stood on the rooftop, desperately trying to control his trembling legs. In Zhuangzi&amp;rsquo;s butterfly dream, was it Zhuangzi dreaming of becoming a butterfly, or was it a butterfly dreaming of becoming Zhuangzi? Just like Kevin now, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether entering the learning machine was a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pondering for almost an hour, Kevin decided to give up thinking. He wandered towards the ground like a leaf losing its anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, twice, three times…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth time he stood on the roof of a high-rise building, Kevin was trembling, and the psychological pain caused by only three deaths almost crushed his spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, Kevin left the roof in a daze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following lives, no matter how Kevin&amp;rsquo;s outward age changed, he acted like a zombie without want or need, or you could say that his consciousness had already turned into a stone. Whether it was being carved hollow by the wind and sand of suffering, or being worn into depressions by the river of life, Kevin was feeling nothing. Now in his life, he would only do one thing - to wait for death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour and a half later, William lit a cigarette, but until he finished, the learning machine showed no sign of being opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was the person dead inside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking this, William walked over and tentatively opened the metal lid of the learning machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin was lying there with his eyes wide open, looking no different from being dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William lightly slapped Kevin&amp;rsquo;s face and Kevin slowly turned his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brother, are you okay?&amp;rdquo; William asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin didn&amp;rsquo;t answer, but just slowly sat up from the learning machine. The electrode sheets on his body fell off due to the pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m asking you something,&amp;rdquo; William asked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Kevin still didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hear, as he walked out of the learning machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It looks like he&amp;rsquo;s gone mad,&amp;rdquo; William muttered, rushing to unlock the iron door before Kevin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin left the room slowly, step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take care, next time… never mind, there won&amp;rsquo;t be a next time.&amp;rdquo; William laughed as he closed the iron door, followed by a series of locking sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in the abandoned factory, there was only the dazed Kevin, who walked aimlessly towards the factory door. The vagabond who was killed by Kevin was still lying there. Of course, this memory was already gone from Kevin&amp;rsquo;s mind at this moment, but even if he could recall it, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t care…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the huge industrial area has one more resident lost in their world…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months later, another oddly dressed man found his way into the industrial district. He is holding a piece of paper, looking around nervously, obviously in search of something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the man stopped in front of an abandoned factory. After hesitating for a while, he finally stepped inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this was witnessed by Kevin from a dark corner. He was covered in dirt, his hair was messy, and his eyes were void. There was a flicker of surprise in his eyes when he saw the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour later, the man reappeared outside the factory. His expression had noticeably changed. He even wore a triumphant smile from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man withdrew a large sum of money from an ATM not far from the factory, then ran back with a bag full of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin, feeling as though he was looking at his past self, was spirited for the first time in his dazed state. His chaotic thoughts had a clear purpose for the first time: to stop that man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin pushed his skinny legs to run towards the man. Before the man could react, Kevin grabbed the big bag full of money and fell hard onto the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was startled, but when he realized his money had been taken, he became angry, and he started to kick the fallen Kevin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A piece of scum dare to steal my money? I&amp;rsquo;ll kick you to death!&amp;rdquo; The man kicked Kevin while he was down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin clung tightly to the bag, using his body to pin it down, despite being unable to exert much strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t go… don&amp;rsquo;t go…&amp;rdquo; Kevin repeated these words over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll kill you, you roach!&amp;rdquo; The man was too enraged to listen to anything. He thought Kevin was begging for mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Kevin was spitting out blood and was barely alive, the man snatched back the bag and spat on Kevin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once I become a councilor, you garbage of society better be prepared to get cleared away.&amp;rdquo; The man said and directly walked into the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin was lying on the ground, motionless. He could feel his internal organs had been shattered by the kicks. He didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the strength left to feel the pain. Those eyes that had finally become spirited were now hollow again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s finally time to die… This life was horrible… The next one should be much better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Kevin now, the thing that was the longest yet the shortest, the fastest yet the slowest, the most divisible yet the most vast, the most negligible yet the most regrettable was not time, but life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these thoughts in his mind, Kevin slowly closed his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Girlfriend Is a Rich Heiress</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/my-girlfriend-is-a-rich-heiress/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 18:44:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/my-girlfriend-is-a-rich-heiress/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*eaeLC9wUTUDHJQzQnLPzxA.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post My Girlfriend Is a Rich Heiress" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day we broke up, I discovered my girlfriend was an ultra-rich second-generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when she was with me, she always pretended to be poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three years, she lived and ate at my expense, even the underwear she wore was from my Wish 9.9 Bundle Purchase for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When breaking up, she said she was tired of the plain congee and dishes, and it was time to change the taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But later, she, with red eyes, said she was willing to compensate me for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clicked on the video in the top trending news. A woman was leaning casually against a luxury car, giving the camera a slight smile. A man was filming. The camera soon started to shake, followed by a burst of screams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She is looking at me! She&amp;rsquo;s so pretty!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the video ended and jumped back to the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the short video over and over dozens of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video was released yesterday. The headline was #Chris attends the event with a new face, suspected of revealing a romantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is a new actor, the overlord of a rich family, and is known for being genuine in the entertainment circle. He is 30 years old and unmarried but never avoids admitting to relationships. Moreover, every girlfriend he revealed was
younger and prettier than the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time his romantic relationship was exposed, many people asked him to teach them how to be a Casanova.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some even joked that even though an 18-year-old girl has just come of age, it would be too late for her to be Chris&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the video was just released, my best friend Jhonny shared it with me immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He joked, &amp;ldquo;This beauty looks like Alice. What&amp;rsquo;s the matter? Did you piss her off, so she went to the entertainment industry to sell her body?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to reply when Johnny sent another message, &amp;ldquo;Damn it, it&amp;rsquo;s not just alike, it&amp;rsquo;s Alice! Go check the trending news.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was when I clicked on the trending news in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, I saw that video at the top of the news list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never expected that a piece of simple entertainment news could turn so many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people initially said that Alice is a freshman in Film Academy and that she was with Chris for money and fame, in the hopes of making her way into the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But soon someone refuted that by saying Alice was not from the Film Academy. She was a campus flower at A University and came from an average family. She worked part-time and paid tuition by herself, which means she was likely being
taken care of financially by Chris due to her lack of funds. This person even posted a student card as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not long after, this piece of news was overturned again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone revealed that Alice was the little princess of the Laurence Group, the only daughter of CEO Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;rsquo;t just any rich second generation, but a fighter jet among them. She usually kept a low profile, and her
hard work and thrift were just to demonstrate her abilities. Since she was young, Chris had always been her ideal type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after chasing after him desperately for five years, the male side did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for Alice&amp;rsquo;s high-profile appearance this time was that Chris was bullied by the event organizer, and she rushed to help him out, making a grand entrance with her luxury car, to save face for her beloved man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fact that Chris didn&amp;rsquo;t deny her presence should be an implied acknowledgment of her feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, along with this hot search, another photo came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice, with an intense gaze, confronted a short, obese middle-aged woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris, on the other hand, was hiding behind her. The typically imposing and aloof handsome man, standing next to the
dazzling woman, had eyes full of love and tenderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this photo was out, the hot search blew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo was a bit blurry, but it had a story of its own, telling the tale of a beautiful, wealthy woman who is
deeply loved, and a star-like man who is completely infatuated with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my chat record with Alice on WeChat was still stuck at last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told me, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m tired, I miss you, let&amp;rsquo;s go have hotpot tomorrow, okay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember what I replied then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, I said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work too hard either. If it&amp;rsquo;s tiring, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to work part-time. I have money, so worst case scenario, I can take care of you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But looking back, my attempts at pretending to be rich in front of Alice were nothing short of a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, Alice in the video was decked out in high-end brands that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even recognize, and the watch she was
wearing alone was worth over a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of wealth was I pretending to have as a worker earning less than 10k a month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hasn&amp;rsquo;t responded to the Weibo link I sent her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drafted and deleted text in the chat box over and over again, but I still didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to ask her what the hell was going on. Was she a rich second-generation? What was her relationship with
Chris?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the trending news was buzzing, I still had a glimmer of hope, hoping to hear her explain in person that all this was a misunderstanding, that she had indeed lied to me, but all because of her helpless situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I could send out any words after much drafting and deleting, I received a message from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only three words: &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s break up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned, and my hand, quicker than my brain, sent out an inquiry, &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m tired of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, then what about your stuff at my place?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Throw them away, they&amp;rsquo;re not worth anything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhonny dragged me out for a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that it&amp;rsquo;s rare for me to experience a breakup, so I should drink away the sorrow, or else it would dishonor the times he was &amp;lsquo;dog food-fed&amp;rsquo; in the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bar was decked out in vibrant colors, a chaotic ambiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhonny clinked my glass and persuaded me, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s okay, Alice is so beautiful. Sleeping with her is a win, considering
your salary, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to afford such a gorgeous girl and it&amp;rsquo;s a blessing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the drink in one gulp, frowned at Jhonny, and said, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t talk about a girl like that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave a guilty smile, &amp;ldquo;Alright, let&amp;rsquo;s drink.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music was blaring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhonny claimed to drink, but his tolerance was very poor. After a few glasses, he started to blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have to work tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the emails in my inbox, I let out a deep sigh. A hard-working man barely had the right to drink away his sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dropping Jhonny off at his house, I took a cab home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to cry, but I endured it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to text her, but I held back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than anything, I was bewildered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was saving money in hopes of buying a house and writing her name on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, she told me her family was not well off so she had always lacked a sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were the moments we shared over the past three years all fake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was she done with me after just one remark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leaned my head against the car window, the uneven road jolted me a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a struggle to get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I got off, I was hit by the cold wind and my head became even more dizzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just sat down by the road, thinking I would go upstairs when I sobered up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t sit for long, someone walked over, blocking the street light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up and saw Alice&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was in a plain black dress, her hair cascading down her back in waves. Her valuable accessories from head to toe made her all the more dazzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was getting more and more out of my league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked down at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How pathetic, do you miss me that much?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was flabbergasted, not knowing what to say for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look in her eyes was cold, like a stranger&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never seen her like this before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She always used to smile. Whenever we made eye contact she would suddenly lean over and hug me, and in a coquettish voice would ask me, &amp;ldquo;Brother, have you loved me more today?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would always shake my head and say no. Then she would tickle me and make me take it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, these memories filled my heart with a throbbing pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath, only after suppressing my tears did I manage to ask her calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What was the reason for all this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything, just waved her hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Maybach car drove over from the corner of the street and stopped nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car door opened, and a few people got down, among them, a girl with vibrant red hair took a few steps toward me
and stood in front of me, asking,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Poor guy, do you still remember who I am?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to associate the person in front of me with the face I remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Amy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, you even remember. I thought you had forgotten.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy took a step back and hooked arms with Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smile on her face was the same as four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Amy in my sophomore year. I was studying at A University and took on part-time jobs to afford tuition. One of
the part-time jobs was tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy was the first student I taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her family was wealthy, but her grades were poor, and she was playful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day of class was tit and tat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by the second class, she started to play tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She threw 500 yuan at me and asked me to help her cover up the fact that she skipped class, then, she prepared to
jump out the window to attend a party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the money, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop her either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afraid that something would happen, I called her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that her gentle mom would be so strict when disciplining her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy was slapped and put under strict house arrest for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this incident, she started to bear a grudge against me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She ran to A university every day making a fuss, clamoring that she would make me pay, and forcing me to apologize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But accepting money to tutor, and informing the parents when the child left, was my duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She got hit was out of my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt sorry but didn&amp;rsquo;t think I did something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I simply ignored Amy as if she didn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she didn&amp;rsquo;t appear after that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, I thought she lost interest and had forgotten about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not expect the next time we met, it would be like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy was watching my expression, apparently knowing I remembered, she pointed boastfully at Alice next to her and said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is my sister, do you know her? She was with you just to get back at me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice frowned, seeming at a loss for words, but in the end, she said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got the whole picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suddenly wanted to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, I did laugh. I looked up at Amy and asked, &amp;ldquo;Now, you got your revenge too, so are we square?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy was stunned, seemingly unprepared for my response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She frowned and nodded hesitantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I guess…I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough of this anyway, but, aren&amp;rsquo;t you mad?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook my head, laughing even more happily, &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing to be mad about, a bet is a bet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then I&amp;rsquo;ll go home first if there&amp;rsquo;s nothing else. Ladies, have fun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After saying this, I turned and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I went upstairs, I could vaguely hear whispers coming from behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No way, is this guy not even sorry? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t he be? Has Ling&amp;rsquo;s appeal stopped working? After three years of dating,
he isn&amp;rsquo;t moved?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After turning off the alarm, I lie on the bed staring at the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind is a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep well last night,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or rather, I barely slept at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s because I searched online, asking &amp;ldquo;How to quickly get over a breakup?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most upvoted answers were: cry, keep yourself busy, read, and think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I sat on the sofa for a long time, and I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I start to tidy up, pack all my belongings, and prepare to move out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house is a two-bedroom apartment, which is large but a bit far from where I work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have rented it if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve broken up, I could just move out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I was packing, I realized that Alice didn&amp;rsquo;t have many belongings, and most of them were ones I bought for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder she said she didn&amp;rsquo;t care about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they are not worth much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to bed at four in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turned off the light, tossed and turned, staring at the refreshing mobile phone screen, switching back and forth in
several apps, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t take in any of the words on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the faint sunlight seeped into the room through the curtains, and then the alarm rang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up with dark circles under my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a shower, and changed clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few sets of strength training, I finally looked a bit better, not so much like a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up my bag and prepared to leave for the subway as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But outside the door, there was a sudden knock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a bit puzzled, pulled back my hand on the doorknob, and looked out through the peephole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all I saw was a patch of red, swaying in my line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hesitant, I opened the door anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to meet Amy who was about to knock her head on the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was startled, and frowned subconsciously, &amp;ldquo;Why are you here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes brightened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if she had seen a savior, she pushed everything in her hands to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Um, I came to apologize to you, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, it&amp;rsquo;s all my fault, I was petty, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, could you please forgive me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stepped back a few steps and did not take the things in her hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were some exquisite shopping bags, each of them printed with the logo of luxury brands, and a bag filled with cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the stuff, Amy&amp;rsquo;s face fell, &amp;ldquo;I just want to apologize to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared at her for a few seconds, and asked, &amp;ldquo;Did Alice send you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She paused, and shook her head, &amp;ldquo;Ah, no, no, Alice doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A male voice suddenly sounded, interrupting Amy&amp;rsquo;s stuttering, &amp;ldquo;I was the one who asked her to come, sorry, Mr. Andy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with the voice, another man walked around the corner of the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was wearing a mask and sunglasses, tightly wrapped, making it hard to see his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;rsquo;s tall and well-proportioned, dressed in understated but high-quality attire, perfectly highlighting his status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stepped forward, standing beside Amy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he took off his sunglasses in front of me and extended his hand to me, &amp;ldquo;Hello, let me introduce myself, I am Chris.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am Amy&amp;rsquo;s brother, I heard about the prank they played on you… so I brought her to apologize to you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris is Amy&amp;rsquo;s brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a little surprised, but thinking about it, it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice and Amy are friends, and she berated the event organizers for Chris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since they are all rich second generations, in the same circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for his later words, I shook my head, &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to apologize to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, it&amp;rsquo;s all Amy&amp;rsquo;s fault, she was too immature, Alice couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand Amy&amp;rsquo;s pestering and was forced to participate in this ridiculous prank, so in essence, I didn&amp;rsquo;t teach my sister properly, it&amp;rsquo;s only right for me to apologize.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he spoke, he took the bags from Amy&amp;rsquo;s hand and irresistibly shoved them into my hands, &amp;ldquo;This is a small gift we bought on the way, consider it as compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Plus, Alice and I are about to get engaged, I know you had some time together, but everyone knows that was just a misunderstanding, so I hope in the future you could stop bothering her, is that okay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is this, Alice&amp;rsquo;s wish?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr. Andy, even though you have broken up now, after all, now you know her real background…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man in front of me nodded and smiled comfortably, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what kind of person he thought I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for that moment, I felt like a clown with nowhere to hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the breakup, I was sad and a little heartbroken, but before that, I never really hated Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I always felt that even though our start was wrong, even though our end was ungracious,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the whole three years, all the little moments we&amp;rsquo;ve had, she should at least know what kind of person I truly am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t care whether she has money or not, and I certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t throw away my dignity and face, to chase after her
persistently for her money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the man in front of me still smiled politely, as if not noticing the changes in my expression, he asked again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr. Andy, you can do it, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final character was typed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sorted out the plan and sent it to the team lead for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the exhaustion that has clouded my mind, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of something Chris said to me this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said to him, &amp;ldquo;…You can rest assured. We&amp;rsquo;ve broken up, so I won&amp;rsquo;t initiate contact with my ex, irrespective of
whether she&amp;rsquo;s a second-generation rich or not. So, please take these things. I don&amp;rsquo;t need them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said this, I put the bags back at Chris&amp;rsquo;s feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than looking down, he laughed and said, &amp;ldquo;These are just some small items, which are not worth much. If Mr.
Andy doesn&amp;rsquo;t like them, just throw them away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said this, he reminded me of Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surreal nonchalance, as if it&amp;rsquo;s devoid of any evil intentions, yet you can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel an immense humiliation
when you hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, in turn, brought back memories of Alice&amp;rsquo;s birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working extremely hard, saving costs to buy her gifts, and presenting to her what she considered as cheap stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She must have found me ridiculous then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague tapped on my desk jolting me back to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed and said, &amp;ldquo;Did you not see the group chat? The manager has been looking for you. He wants you in his office.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ahh okay, got it.&amp;rdquo; I hurriedly set aside my scattered thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After thanking my colleagues, I went to the manager&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager had asked about an old issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company wanted me to host a car show in Atlanta, but was lacking experience. Hence, they needed someone from the
headquarters to oversee the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This position offered a promotion and double the salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only issue was that even after the project ended, there would still be a possibility of being posted to Atlanta
for at least half a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half a month ago, just when the news broke, the manager had asked me once about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had tactfully refused him by saying that I lacked experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the manager probably knew that it was just an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, he asked me again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one week of organizing my belongings, I left my unused stuff at the rental house and sent my luggage which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t carry to Jhonny. I planned to ask him to ship them to me after I found a place to stay in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had booked a hotel for me in Atlanta. I just needed to go there after I got off the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the farewell meal, Jhonny insisted on a hot pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to university with Jhonny and went to the usual place we used to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to choosing the soup base for the hotpot, I habitually chose the &amp;lsquo;Yuan Yang&amp;rsquo; hotpot (spicy and non-spicy
soup base).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jhonny looked puzzled and asked, &amp;ldquo;Wait, when did you stop eating spicy food?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a bit surprised and said, &amp;ldquo;I do eat spicy food.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then why did you choose the Yuan Yang hot pot? We both eat spicy food. We should have chosen the Nine Palace hotpot. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then did I come back to my senses. I saw the small tick behind the Yuan Yang hotpot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I accidentally ticked the wrong box,&amp;rdquo; I said, then crossed the tick and reselected the Nine Palace hotpot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in truth, it was because I was used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Alice didn&amp;rsquo;t eat spicy food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She encountered it when we had just started dating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thought hotpot places were too noisy and would rather eat at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But later on, she would ask me if I felt like eating hot pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, when we chose the Nine Palace hotpot, she was sweating all over, gulping down cold water to survive. She hardly ate anything but consumed a lot of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when we left the hot pot place, she was still stubborn and said, &amp;ldquo;You helped a lot, brother. I think I can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;handle spicy food better than before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing her pretty side profile under the streetlight, and her child-like silly laugh, I felt a sense of tenderness towards her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, we have only eaten the &amp;lsquo;Yuan Yang&amp;rsquo; hotpot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I returned to my senses, Jhonny had already taken the menu and efficiently ordered some dishes. He asked me if I wanted to add more meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook my head and said, &amp;ldquo;No need, you order.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to save money on me, Andy. Otherwise, you&amp;rsquo;ll be paying for the next meal. I&amp;rsquo;m planning on spending all your money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, then let&amp;rsquo;s go for a buffet next time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Get lost!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We teased each other and laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation ranged from all aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we avoided talking about the real reason for my departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have work tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both had a drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I just had a flush on my face and was a bit dizzy, Jhonny was completely drunk. He was singing &amp;lsquo;I knew you were
trouble&amp;rsquo; by my ear, not only off-key but also out of tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I held onto him with one hand and used the other hand to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unwittingly, he ran away when I was swiping my card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finally paying, I found him leaning against the dining table next to the counter, talking to other customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;ldquo;You seem like a player to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was completely flabbergasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rushed over to pick him up and rushed to apologize to the customers whose meal was interrupted by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, someone called my name, &amp;ldquo;Andy, what a coincidence!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then I realized that Amy was one of the people sitting at the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback and a sense of unease started to rise within me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy was here, so would…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned my head stiffly and as expected, Alice was sitting just beside me, outside the dining table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhonny kept insisting and pointing at her, &amp;ldquo;Young lady, you are indeed a player. In my opinion, you should do good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deeds for the rest of your life, become a nun to atone for your sins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Alice seemed unmoved by his words and just stared at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four people were at the table, and everyone was quiet. No one dared to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The embarrassment made my scalp go numb, and I regretted letting Jhonny drink that last bottle of beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to control him and was about to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he used all his strength to struggle, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t stop me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I managed to drag Jhonny out of the hot pot restaurant and squat at the door, I was already sweating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, I was hailing a cab,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I said to Jhonny, &amp;ldquo;Stay quiet for a bit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he looked at me for a while, and suddenly he sniffed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Andy, for a woman, you even abandoned your buddies. Are you still considered a friend?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes gradually reddened as he was muddled by the alcohol, and tears began to drop. He grabbed my sleeve and
sobbed loudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two men were pulling and tugging at each other, which seemed bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passersby were looking at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know, Jhonny regards me as his family. I felt a bit sour in my nose for a moment. I wanted to give him a tissue to wipe his tears, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any after searching my pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Use this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone behind me spoke, the voice familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hand that reached out to me was fair and slender, holding a beautiful handkerchief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used my sleeve to dry the tears on Jhonny&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person took back her hand and asked casually, &amp;ldquo;Did you block me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still didn&amp;rsquo;t answer, bowed my head to finish calling the cab, and then helped Jhonny to wait by the roadside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she caught up and grabbed my sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forcefully shook off her hand, and finally raised some anger, &amp;ldquo;Alice, are you sick? You are the one who said you
had enough and broke up. You warned me not to harass you, what are you doing now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I shook her off, her eyebrows were locked, but in the end, she only said three words, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to me, it just sounded funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alice, don&amp;rsquo;t you think your apology is a little too late?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She saw me smiling, but frowned, &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re upset, just scold me, don&amp;rsquo;t be like this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, I was indeed a little upset, but now I don&amp;rsquo;t care. For three years, even if you raise a cat or a dog, you
would feel some emotions. But you, you&amp;rsquo;re not worthy, you aren&amp;rsquo;t, so now I just feel relieved that we broke up early.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone vibrated, it was the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the taxi parked by the side of the road, turned off the screen, and turned around, saying, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m leaving, and I
hope to never see you again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got home, I received a friend request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no profile picture or remark, the request message only had three words: I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I easily guessed who sent this message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to my surprise, the other party was very persistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tried several different accounts, and the request messages were diverse, from &amp;ldquo;Handsome man, get to know you&amp;rdquo;, to
&amp;ldquo;Bar recommendation&amp;rdquo;, then to &amp;ldquo;I am your leader, I switched numbers, add my new number.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, she seemed to finally realize that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fooled, and filled in desperately, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, bro, I
know I was wrong, but can you give me a chance to explain?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it funny and only replied to the last one, &amp;ldquo;Explain what? Explain that you are a liar, or explain that you
are playing both ends against the middle. You want to break up peacefully, then invite me to your wedding with Chris?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the other party finally kept quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival in Atlanta, the branch arranged for people to pick up at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person holding the sign with my name was long-haired and stunningly beautiful. But because the temperament was too prominent, standing among a group of little girls waiting for their idols at the airport, it was obviously out of
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, Andy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, Janey.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager of the planning department in Atlanta and my new boss is named Janey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I heard this name, I froze for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I thought you would send an assistant to pick me up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey explained, &amp;ldquo;The assistant is off, her cat is going to give birth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Could even take a leave because her cat is giving birth, is the working atmosphere of the branch so relaxed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While leading the way for me, Janey said with a smile, &amp;ldquo;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s convenient for fishing, so you won&amp;rsquo;t regret it after you come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also amused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new boss is humorous, which is a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension of leaving home and switching cities was somewhat alleviated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to the hotel, Janey simply introduced the situation of the branch and the work that I would be taking over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workload is not small, but it is relatively easy to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just that I had just been transferred, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar enough with the new colleagues, so it would take
some time to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive at the hotel and check in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original plan was to wait for the work to stabilize and then choose a weekend to rent a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the car, Janey told me that it would be very busy for the next while due to a large-scale exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived a few days early and reported to the company next Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not take these few days to find a house first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just after contacting the agency and preparing to go out, I suddenly received a message from Jhonny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Andy, Alice came to find me, she asked me if you moved, and where you are now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frowned, thinking that my response yesterday was already clear enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of her persistence now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitive spirit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she feel that her charm was belittled because of my indifference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent a voice message directly to Johnny, firmly saying, &amp;ldquo;No matter what she asks you, don&amp;rsquo;t tell her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I understand, I haven&amp;rsquo;t said anything. However, she drank too much and seemed to have cried. She said that
initially, she indeed approached you because of Amy, but after being with you, she had truly fallen for you. She intended to find an opportunity to explain everything and reveal her true identity to you, but she was afraid to hurt you, so she kept dragging. She didn&amp;rsquo;t expect you to see that video first… She said a lot, but I can&amp;rsquo;t remember all of it. Do you want to hear her explanation?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No need, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to explain. Initially, I was considerate of her because she was struggling with her studies, to make her work less part-time and concentrate on her studies, I worked hard to earn money and even got hospitalized due to exhaustion. Yet, she knew everything but deceived me for three years…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through typing in the chat box, I lost my train of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, over the past three years, Alice never asked me for anything. Working, earning money, and striving hard for our shared future, were all choices I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for help, didn&amp;rsquo;t see it, and naturally, she didn&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for her claims, at first, she approached me with a purpose, but later got emotionally attached, I don&amp;rsquo;t doubt them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can disguise your motives, and use language to deceive, but subconscious reactions and eye contact can&amp;rsquo;t be faked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless times I was busy with work and left her aside. When I finally finished and went to find her, I could see
the disappointment and loneliness on her face, which instantly transitioned into cheerful happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my phone died on my way home from work, and she ran out in slippers and searched for me for two hours, only to find that I had already returned home, her first reaction was to hug me with reddened eyes, not blaming me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is a pure girl who differentiates between love and hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When protecting her favorite person conflicted with avenging her best friend, she was probably anxious too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between revealing the truth to face the issue and continuously dragging to postpone the conflict, she was indecisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, when the truth revealed itself, I became the one who was abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say that feelings between men and women are a struggle, either the east wind overpowers the west wind, or
vice versa, but I disagree with this statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a good relationship should be built on equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because of Alice&amp;rsquo;s deception, this relationship was unequal from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe she had a reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind those actions that have hurt me deeply, was something that she couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, these things are meaningless to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we are not from the same world, we briefly fell in love due to a lie, and when the truth was revealed, we had to return to our realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment the lie was exposed, everything between us had already ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of this, looking at the text that I had finished typing in the chat box, I suddenly felt tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things and people that I decided to let go, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to bring them up and complain about them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath and deleted all the text, replacing it with a single sentence,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alice is getting engaged to Chris, her affairs have nothing to do with me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person on the other side was shocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wow, she&amp;rsquo;s still clinging onto you even though she&amp;rsquo;s getting engaged, is she sick?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Today she was passionately talking to me but didn&amp;rsquo;t retaliate at all, I thought she knew she was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She almost fooled me, good-looking people are the worst.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But, Andy, what do you plan to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Should we expose her? I can&amp;rsquo;t swallow this down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the person on the other side calmed down, I said, &amp;ldquo;No need, since we&amp;rsquo;ve broken up, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to keep getting entangled with her. Just ignore her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay, I understand. I promise to keep my mouth shut, I won&amp;rsquo;t let her annoy you again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s the situation over there? Is the South hot? Is it very different from where we are? Are you getting used to
the company? Are the colleagues easy to get along with?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early May, the north is still at the junction of spring and summer, sunny days occasionally mixed with a few days of rain, jackets and short sleeves are put to use, neither can be put away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Atlanta in the south had already entered summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glanced outside the hotel window, the same tall buildings, hurrying pedestrians on the road, it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem too
different from New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said on the phone, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit hot, but it&amp;rsquo;s bearable. I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived early, and haven&amp;rsquo;t reported to the company yet.
The department manager picked me up in person, seem like a nice person.&amp;rdquo;
Johnny immediately became alert and anxiously asked, &amp;ldquo;Why is the manager doing such a small thing as picking up people, male or female? Is it a middle-aged woman who thinks you&amp;rsquo;re handsome and wants an office romance?&amp;rdquo;
I laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stop talking nonsense, the branch staff is young, she&amp;rsquo;s not much older than me. She had to pick me up only because
the assistant took a sudden leave and no one else could replace her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s impressive to be a manager at such a young age, so what does she look like, pretty?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s… pretty good-looking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of Johnny&amp;rsquo;s question, I subconsciously recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the face, Janey can&amp;rsquo;t be said to be cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the airport, she stood in the crowd with a sign, definitely drawing quite a few people&amp;rsquo;s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a topic on the internet before, discussing whether cute or sexy is more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinions were diverse and clashed with each other but a single concise statement topped the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true goddess lacks neither cuteness nor sexiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey fully confirmed this statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exquisite features, a tall nose bridge, and a well-proportioned body. Even with the most common long straight hair
and work wear, she is exceptionally eye-catching on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps fearing that I was down, Johnny chatted with me on trivial topics and was reluctant to end the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was me who took the initiative to tell him to go to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hesitated for a bit then hung up the phone. Before hanging up, he said if I felt uncomfortable I should let him
know and not suppress it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I complained with a smile, &amp;ldquo;I know, don&amp;rsquo;t act like an old lady.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hanging up the phone, I felt very warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I had to view the house in the afternoon,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took my bag and went out to find a place to eat lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to the meal, I added the contact information of the rental house agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This agent was recommended to me by Janey when she heard I was looking for a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent was very efficient. After I sent over my requirements, they quickly matched six to seven houses for me and
made an appointment for me to view them in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For commuting convenience, I wanted to rent near the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no exception, they were all expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A twenty square meters studio, excluding utilities, costs nineteen hundred dollars. The kitchen was next to the
bathroom, and the washer was squeezed next to the stove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After viewing countless houses, a flat that was up for rent seemed the most fitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was sixty square meters, slightly away from the company, approximately one kilometer, and walkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master bedroom had been rented out, the room available for rent was eighteen square meters and included a small
bathroom. The kitchen and the living room were shared space, the rent was fifteen hundred dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the house was neat and had good lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was instantly tempted, but there was only one issue - the other tenant was female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One man and one woman living together sounds ambiguous and stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from a realistic perspective, it brings about trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the agent kept persuading me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house was newly posted not long ago, has high-cost performance, and will be rented out quickly. Once it is gone, there will be no identical ones left. The other tenant was nice; not a troublesome girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just because the roommate was switching jobs and moving, the room was vacant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with my preference for the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hesitating for a while, I finally followed the agent&amp;rsquo;s advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to wait until the other tenant got off work, to see what kind of person she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent received a message that the other tenant had returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the door opened, Janey walked in with her bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, now I understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did the agent&amp;rsquo;s contact information just happen to be stored in Janey&amp;rsquo;s phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My roommate is changing jobs and is looking for a person to share the rent, is that you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey reluctantly replied, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, are you also planning to live near the office?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent, sandwiched between us, looked at me and then at her, said bewildered, &amp;ldquo;You guys know each other, what a
coincidence?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both smiled bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it&amp;rsquo;s quite a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually decided not to share the rent with Janey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, sharing a living space with the opposite sex is complicated enough,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the co-worker relationship on top of this, it&amp;rsquo;s embarrassingly awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe Janey thinks the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After saying goodbye to the agent,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a taxi back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I planned to spare another day to look at a few more rooms the agent recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect was the arrival of Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel I am staying at was arranged by the company. Even Johnny doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the exact location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the lobby of the hotel, I was stunned to see Alice sitting lazily on the sofa, playing with her mobile phone,
attracting frequent attention from the crowd with her beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she come to find me on purpose, or was it a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no matter which one it is, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have any intersection with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I raised my arm to cover my face, trying to pass through the hall quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to bump into someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A middle-aged man, slightly fat, reeked of alcohol, leaning on the counter and lighting a cigarette. I bumped the lit
lighter directly onto his hair, burning off a tuft of hair on his forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man had a slow reaction due to alcohol and even made eye contact when he raised his eyes to look at his hair.
Only when the smell of burnt hair filled the air,he come back to his senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he hastily extinguished the fire on his head, he smashed the lighter on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t you see where you&amp;rsquo;re going, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sorry, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What nonsense, you didn&amp;rsquo;t see me, who&amp;rsquo;s this big?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His roar of anger attracted the attention of everyone in the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not good at dealing with drunken people, especially in a situation where I have to deal with a middle-aged man
who looks strikingly similar to someone from my nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My palms were sweating unconsciously, and I wanted to escape, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I kept apologizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until someone came over and blocked the verbal abuse of the drunk with her body, &amp;ldquo;Are you going to let him scold you
like this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up and directly met Alice&amp;rsquo;s hurt and aggrieved gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you think you should wait for me to explain before you decide to escape?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I could speak, the cursing drunk got furious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who the hell is this little bitch, mind your own business, are you looking for death?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can you be quiet? You just want money, don&amp;rsquo;t you? Is this enough?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice&amp;rsquo;s gaze was sharp, and she took off her wristwatch and threw it directly into the drunk&amp;rsquo;s arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The million-dollar watch successfully calmed the drunk down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t let her continue like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already broken up. There shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any connection between us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I had to suppress my feelings, walk around her, and face the drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t know this person. Can you give the watch back to her? I can compensate for your burnt hair, however
much you demand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t carry any cash on me, so I had to take out my credit card as proof that I really would pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice&amp;rsquo;s eyebrows furrowed, and the emotions in her eyes deepened, &amp;ldquo;Andy, what are you doing? Are you trying to
alienate me?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Alice, we&amp;rsquo;ve already broken up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to break up with you. There are some things that I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you right now, but I can assure you,
I will not marry Chris. Can you give me some more time? I will soon call off the engagement…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no need.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Andy, can you stop it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friend of the drunken man, seeing us quarrel, finally sensed something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came over and pulled the man away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this drew the attention of the crowd, many people were watching the drama secretly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned around and prepared to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she held my arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t you give me another chance? I know I lied to you, but I came here to apologize, I know I was wrong, can&amp;rsquo;t you
forgive me once? You&amp;rsquo;re just going to let go of our three-year relationship, is your heart made of stone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes tinged red, irrespective of the people around her, she stared at me persistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time she has lost control since we broke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of things to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the end, I didn&amp;rsquo;t explain anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I unwrapped her fingers gripping my arm one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating some distance from her, I said, &amp;ldquo;Alice, we are from two different worlds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned around, got on the elevator, and haven&amp;rsquo;t looked back since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what her reaction was after hearing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after I returned to my hotel room, I received a text message from a strange number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were only four words, &amp;ldquo;But I can&amp;rsquo;t let go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she can&amp;rsquo;t let go of, she didn&amp;rsquo;t say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened and read the message for a while, then deleted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to officially report to the company three days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I was a bit nervous and worried about how to fit in with my new colleagues at the first meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to my surprise, after completing the onboarding procedures and being led by HR into the office, I discovered that
there was nobody inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where did everyone go? They should be in the office at this point,&amp;rdquo; I wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HR was taken aback and didn&amp;rsquo;t expect this situation. They promptly dialed Janey&amp;rsquo;s number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then did they tell me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sara has gone to a meeting with the Editor. The rest are at the exhibition site. You wait here for a bit. When Sara
comes back, she will take you over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offline activities are the most troublesome, especially large-scale events such as auto shows. There are many and
varied issues, and it is normal for the entire department to watch the scene together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found my seat and sat down, arranging my things while waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only after less than five minutes, a person suddenly broke in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Boss! There&amp;rsquo;s trouble at the site, you need to go there quickly, or Steven will…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tall and thin boy with glasses and very pale skin. Seeing that I was the only one in the office, his words
came to a sudden stop, and he froze in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;May I ask… who are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My name is Andy, I&amp;rsquo;m new here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, I know you! You&amp;rsquo;re the big shot from headquarters, I&amp;rsquo;m Victor. But boss, you are so handsome! I was supposed to pick you up from the airport that day, but my cat was having kittens and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t leave. By the way, do you like cats?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor casually sat down next to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next second, he sprung up immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ah no, I can&amp;rsquo;t sit down, I need to find the boss on the scene, something has happened there. Andy, do you know where the boss is, our manager, Sara?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know where she is, but the HR said she was having a meeting with the Editor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s it.&amp;rdquo; Victor groaned in agony, visibly getting a headache, &amp;ldquo;It must be the Editor, she&amp;rsquo;s the most difficult to
deal with, talkative and short-tempered. Every time the boss has a meeting with her, it must start with a whole morning at least, and she doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow interruptions in between, what should we do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing him like this, in the end, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but ask, &amp;ldquo;What happened at the scene?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor explained, and only then did I understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young planner in the office got into a quarrel with the workers on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason was that the workers misread the blueprints and swapped the billboards of two car brands, which needed to
be pried off and reinstalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the workers felt that the two exhibition areas were of the same size and it was not necessary to install them
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, although the two exhibition areas were of the same size, the distances from the entrance were very different, and the brand owners naturally gave different booth fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that there was a problem in this communication process, and it evolved from a discussion to a quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the worker who led the strike sat on the ground on strike, but the progress on scene couldn&amp;rsquo;t be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pondered for a moment and said to Victor, &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t I go to the scene with you? I have encountered similar
situations before and may be able to help.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Really?&amp;rdquo; Victor&amp;rsquo;s eyes lit up and thanked me repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distance between the exhibition hall and the office building was neither far nor near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took twenty minutes to take the subway and walk a few hundred meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we got there, the workers had sat down on the ground in protest, and no one was working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young man in a shirt, holding a fan, squatted at the door with a worried expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easy to guess that this must be Victor&amp;rsquo;s other colleague, Steven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue was spacious, and as Victor and I walked in, it naturally attracted the attention of the people inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the worker who led the strike just glanced at us and warned, &amp;ldquo;No matter how many people you bring today, it&amp;rsquo;s no use. We won&amp;rsquo;t take this oppression anymore, you should quickly settle the wages from the past few days, and then we can leave.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven heard this, sprung up angrily, and wanted to start quarreling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly signaled Victor to stop him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I stepped forward and stood in front of the leading worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Duke, when did you come to Atlanta? Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you tell me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker paused, seemingly not expecting me to say this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Boy, don&amp;rsquo;t you call out randomly, I don&amp;rsquo;t recognize you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know me? I am Andy, didn&amp;rsquo;t we just meet in our hometown when my cousin got married two years ago?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker still frowned, but his tone was less harsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You must have mistaken me for someone else, boy, I don&amp;rsquo;t know you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is that so, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry uncle, I might have mistaken you for someone else. You look a bit like my cousin Duke, and I
am alone here, feeling a bit homesick.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No problem, no need to apologize.&amp;rdquo; The worker&amp;rsquo;s expression softened and he waved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I spoke up, &amp;ldquo;So, uncle, I am the new person in charge. I heard from my colleagues that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to
continue with this job anymore. Could you tell me what happened?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You still asking me what happened?&amp;rdquo; The worker&amp;rsquo;s expression was not good when mentioned this, &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it because of your colleague? She said it would take a week to finish the job, tomorrow is the last day, but now we have to take down the completed things and reinstall them, how can the work be done? Drag the time in the midday sun, don&amp;rsquo;t let us rest, we are also humans, if we don&amp;rsquo;t rest how can we work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His tone was unkind, but he at least didn&amp;rsquo;t refuse to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guessed the cause and was relieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s their fault. They don&amp;rsquo;t say whether to do this job, who has the strength to work without a break
after midday.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing me agree with him, the worker showed a grateful expression, &amp;ldquo;Exactly, boy, it&amp;rsquo;s not that we don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this job, but mainly because everyone is hungry and can&amp;rsquo;t work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought for a moment and said, &amp;ldquo;How about this? We will order lunch boxes for you. After you finish eating, take half an hour to change the sign. Is that okay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker&amp;rsquo;s eyes brightened and after a fleeting exchange of glances with his brothers behind, he nodded without much hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This… could work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor called to order meals familiarly and asked the delivery to bring the meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the two of us went to the door to wait for the takeaway, he asked me excitedly, &amp;ldquo;Andy, you are so brilliant. How did you do it? Before you came, we had been communicating with them for a long time. We used all kinds of methods but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get through to them. Why did they agree as soon as you came?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled and explained, &amp;ldquo;Communication is not difficult, just need to understand each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of the car show is in the prime location of the convention center, surrounded by towering buildings, and shopping malls and entertainment facilities are everywhere, vibrant and lively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for these workers, this place is very unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excessively high rent drove away most of the small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did not understand the food delivery app, were busy all morning, they needed to walk a long way to find a
suitable place to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So their refusal to delay their lunch work is not unwilling, but they can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if the rest time is reduced, they will not be able to find a place to eat nearby and will starve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor opened his mouth doubtfully, &amp;ldquo;But Andy, why didn&amp;rsquo;t they say directly if they had difficulty eating? Ordering a
meal isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because they care too much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They earn a living by selling their labor, haven&amp;rsquo;t received much education, and are no longer young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this rapidly developing era, where everything is rushing towards better and newer, they seem to have been left
behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything wrong, but they were always feeling uncomfortable because they were unable to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are all like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more they care, the more sensitive they become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those seemingly stubborn and indisputable insistences are often not due to being superior, but inferiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Victor could speak, a voice came from behind us, &amp;ldquo;But sometimes, things and people that make people feel
inferior, maybe they should not be insisted on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned my head and saw Janey walking out of the exhibition hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was striding with an air of determination she had just rushed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The welcoming dinner at night was held near the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey was the host, taking everyone to have Chongqing hot pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the accident that happened during the day, several colleagues got to know each other in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the already met Victor, operation Steven, there was an editor named Chen, and a copywriter named Hu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;re about the same age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere was more harmonious than I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more wine was served, the atmosphere at the table became more lively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven stood up and made a toast, his expression naughty, &amp;ldquo;Thanks to handsome Andy for saving me. If I had known that
the big shot sent by the headquarters was a handsome guy, I would have gone to the airport to pick him up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor laughed and interjected, &amp;ldquo;Andy, don&amp;rsquo;t listen to her. Steven is a heartbreaker, she falls for every handsome
guy she sees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven took the ribbing well and retorted, &amp;ldquo;What about me? Carla is the worst. She kept the resume secret from us and went to pick up the handsome guy at the airport. Isn&amp;rsquo;t this considered lustful?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re talking nonsense. The boss went by herself because she couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anyone when I asked for leave. It&amp;rsquo;s not the same as you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How is it not the same? It&amp;rsquo;s all lust. You can&amp;rsquo;t double standard just because the boss is prettier than me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They laughed and teased each other, and it was obvious that they got along well normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor was quite feisty, and Steven quickly lost the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half-jokingly, she asked Janey for help, &amp;ldquo;Boss, tell us the truth. Did you decide to pick up the person yourself
after seeing the resume?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she asked this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The others also joined in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up and, to my surprise, made eye contact with Janey, who was sitting across from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she just smiled and didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to want to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the imminent opening of the exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online promotion and offline brand connection have reached a crucial stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the promotional video, Janey and the editors spent the whole day shooting materials on-site and editing them at
the office, going back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the rest of the team to monitor the situation on-site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All kinds of problems arose in unexpected ways from unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was busy all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night&amp;rsquo;s welcoming dinner, however, became a rare occasion for everyone to gather in the same place after two
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as soon as mid-month passed, the temperature in Atlanta became increasingly fierce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat, with its humidity, felt like a net that drained one&amp;rsquo;s energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even if things were going well and we could go out for lunch, everyone still couldn&amp;rsquo;t leave the air conditioning in the break room and ordered takeout again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were waiting for the food, Victor sat next to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took out his phone and didn&amp;rsquo;t look at it for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, he exclaimed excitedly, &amp;ldquo;Look at Weibo, my female goddess is engaged!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he held up his phone in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could only clearly see the topic page on the screen, which read, &amp;ldquo;#Chris is low-key engaged to the young lady of
Laurence Group&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned and didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor thought I didn&amp;rsquo;t know these two people and explained happily, &amp;ldquo;Andy, you don&amp;rsquo;t know these two people? Didn&amp;rsquo;t
you watch the trending news the other day? This couple has been good to ship for a while. The woman is a wealthy heiress, but she has liked Chris since she was young. After being treated as a little sister for many years, she left her family out of anger, supported herself through hard work, got a degree from a big college, and started her own company. Then, she came back confidently, supported Chris at an event, and changed from a little sister into a stunning beauty. Chris was finally moved and accepted this relationship. What is this? This is sweet love!&amp;rdquo;
So that&amp;rsquo;s how their story is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven, who had just opened a bottle of water, started talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re stupid, aren&amp;rsquo;t you? What sweet love, everything is fake, it&amp;rsquo;s all business. There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as true
love in the entertainment industry. You&amp;rsquo;re the kind of fool who believes in it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My best friend is a marketer. She told me these two people are not as they seem. The trending news before was all
hype. Chris wanted to promote his company, so he hired people to write press releases and set the tone. The woman didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get engaged at all, she was forced into it. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t reveal anything because of family power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor glared at him, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t talk nonsense.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cut, it&amp;rsquo;s all true. If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe it, just forget it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two of them were arguing back and forth, but they couldn&amp;rsquo;t avoid that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a little stuffy in the break room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up and wanted to go outside for some fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I ran into Janey, who was carrying coffee to the break room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she saw me, she handed me a cup of coffee and asked with a smile, &amp;ldquo;Have you eaten yet?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook my head, &amp;ldquo;The delivery hasn&amp;rsquo;t arrived yet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you go out for lunch during the break?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s too hot outside, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like moving.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why not wait in the break room with the air conditioning on?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s stuffy in there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excuse was too lame, even I felt a bit inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Janey didn&amp;rsquo;t expose me, she put the coffee at the door and called the people inside to come and get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she smiled and said to me, &amp;ldquo;I also think it&amp;rsquo;s stuffy in the room. Why don&amp;rsquo;t we wait together?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to be alone and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after all, she was being kind and it was hard to refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iced Americano was a bit bitter, and my stomach was empty, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t dare to drink much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I muttered a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Janey heard, she pulled out a few pieces of candy from somewhere and put them in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colorful candy wrapper was shiny and holographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my hand was only filled with red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, I liked red the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how did Janey know to carry these around with her, and how did she know…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet my surprised eyes, Janey suddenly smiled, she looked a bit helpless and said, &amp;ldquo;You little liar forgot
everything about me. If I knew earlier, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have given back the candy I owed you.&amp;rdquo;
12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The familiar tone and address finally awakened my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re the little dwarf who got bullied!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was eight years old, I was staying at my uncle&amp;rsquo;s house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, my parents divorced and started their new families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle, feeling sorry for me having no one to take care of me, welcomed me into his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle and aunt were the kindest people in the world, and they took good care of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no matter how good it was, there was still a barrier between us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my cousin did something wrong, he would get beaten, run away from home, or get scolded by both parents for wanting to buy a cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even so, he never lacked anything he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was always envious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I missed my parents too much, I would skip classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would climb over the broken railing at the school and wander around the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was on one of those afternoons when I skipped class that I met the little dwarf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was huddled alone in a corner, wearing a delicate little dress, but she was curled up, with a few fierce-looking
dogs beside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was scared too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I picked up a stick and ran towards the pack of dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stray dogs would back off when faced with aggression, so I drove them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly helped her up and asked if she was okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she was fine, just really hungry and couldn&amp;rsquo;t outrun those dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked pitiful, her stomach growling audibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much thought, I gave her half of the candy I had saved up for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes lit up, and she ate it greedily, then she promised me that she would repay me by buying me more candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we parted ways, she asked me where I lived and what my name was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told her my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it came to the address, I thought of another problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle and aunt didn&amp;rsquo;t know I skipped classes, let alone that I had made a new friend. If this person came to my
house to give me candy, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t everything be exposed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I lied and said I lived near the school, in the tallest house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, I came to school every day, so we would eventually meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, we became friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told me about her parents fighting, and the new games at her desk, and I told her how much I missed home and asked her to study hard and not mind what others said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But later on, my uncle&amp;rsquo;s job changed and we had to move, which also meant changing schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I never thought that our next encounter would be under these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt surprised and a little curious, and asked, &amp;ldquo;How did you recognize me? Actually, it has been so long, how could
you still remember me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey looked conflicted and explained, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you remember that I said I would repay you? After that day, I had been saving money all along in order to buy you candy. I smashed all the piggy banks and went to every supermarket nearby.
But when I wanted to give you the candy, I found out that you gave me a fake address. So every day, I emptied my school bag and carried candies around to find you. But then the teacher found out and told my mom. I was severely punished and all the candies were thrown away. I cried for many days at that time. How can I forget?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that our meeting from back then would have such a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a little guilty, suppressing a smile as I apologized, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I moved afterward.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, this incident caused me too much harm, I can&amp;rsquo;t forgive you so easily.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay, then you can call the police.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sudden response caught Janey off guard, and she burst into laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her smile was bright and cheerful, and the frustration that had accumulated in my heart for the past few days
dissipated a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to the break room with the takeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that the tense atmosphere inside had changed dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor and Steven, who were arguing just now, were now huddled together, focusing on their phone screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This seems like a PR crisis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s over, the page crashed and I can&amp;rsquo;t refresh it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you log out and log back in?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two of them were too serious, and when Janey and I entered the room, they only briefly greeted us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey asked, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s going on? Why are you two so focused?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven kept refreshing his phone a few more times, seemingly without success, before looking up to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Something big has happened, come and enjoy the show.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just now, Chris announced his engagement officially, and various marketing accounts were praising it, but now someone has leaked that a fight broke out at the engagement ceremony!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frowned and subconsciously asked, &amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No one knows the details, but a paparazzo sneaked in and captured the chaotic scene at the engagement ceremony. They
said that the woman didn&amp;rsquo;t even know about the engagement, she was lured there and went berserk once she found out, and then her younger sister was the first to attack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video that came out this time was quite blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with the long-distance filming, there was no sound at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Chris was a star, with high recognition, and combined with his expensive suit and every strand of hair
effortlessly stylish, he was truly eye-catching in the footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video started with Alice pushing open the door and entering the venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene was luxurious, with everyone in suits and formal attire, so when Alice entered in casual clothes, she
immediately attracted most of the attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris approached her, but she avoided him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, she looked frustrated as she questioned him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the communication seemed difficult, and Alice directly knocked over the engagement signboard with their photo on
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, Amy rushed out and grabbed Alice&amp;rsquo;s hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene was completely chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security guards approached, the person filming was discovered, and the video abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor sounded resentful, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s terrible, my CP became real for less than an hour, and now it&amp;rsquo;s broken.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And someone said that Alice has had a boyfriend for a long time in private, they met while she was studying at A
University and even lived together. Everyone says that guy is a freeloader, but now she&amp;rsquo;s causing a scene at her own engagement for him. Ah, the goddess is confused!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean causing a scene for that guy?&amp;rdquo; Steven interjected, &amp;ldquo;Victor, you&amp;rsquo;re too naive. This kind of wealthy
heiress has been playing around outside. How could she have only been in one relationship? I think she&amp;rsquo;s just a pure
scumbag, not ready to get engaged yet. Why would there be so many reasons? Carla, Lu Ge, what do you guys think?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey said, &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t know the whole story, so no comment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to join in this conversation, so I just shook my head&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work, I should have cleaned my room first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seeing the big and small unopened boxes sent by Johnny all over the floor, I got lazy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the necessities of life are out, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to unpack these later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking this way, I turned a blind eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a shower first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrapped in a towel, I found several missed calls on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unknown number, but the area code was local in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking this way, I dialed the number back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, it was the hotel I had stayed at before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front desk said that someone had mistakenly sent my package to the hotel, they were unable to contact the sender,
so they could only inquire about my current address and sent it to me for processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who sent me something and sent it to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did Johnny get it wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the thing is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s really not good to bother the front desk, so I had to give my current address and contact information and
tell them to call when the delivery arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hung up, I asked Johnny if she had sent anything to me at the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She denied it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was full of doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to send a message to Janey to confirm whether the company had sent any materials to my old address by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the hotel was booked by the company when I first arrived in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Janey didn&amp;rsquo;t know what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no choice but to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, half an hour later, the deliveryman knocked at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without thinking, I opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I found out that it was Alice standing outside the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was dressed in black, wearing a duckbill hat, and holding a huge suitcase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangs were pressed down by the hat, covering a little eyes, the whole person stood in the shadow of the corridor,
vaguely to see a hint of red lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of the video where Amy pulled her hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frowning, and asked &amp;ldquo;Why are you here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did you bribe the hotel to reveal my address?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shook her head, &amp;ldquo;No, they refused to tell me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I sent a package to the hotel and had the deliveryman run away after dropping it off, as I wanted to see how they
would deal with it. And as I expected, they called you, and when they went to arrange delivery, I overheard the address.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story was way too convoluted, and my first instinct,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was neither to call the cops for harassment nor to compliment her for being clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just as I was trying to figure out what to say to get rid of her, she closed her eyes and collapsed on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was startled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reflexively held her up, the hat was bumped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the light from the room, I finally saw that her face was unnaturally flushed, and her wrist, which I had briefly
touched just now, was alarmingly hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She lay on the carpet, but was still trying hard to get up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because of the fever, her red eyes were glistening with tears and her voice was hoarse as she murmured
something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting closer, I heard what she was saying, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, brother, it&amp;rsquo;s my fault.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just as I was at a loss for what to do with her,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a rush of footsteps in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a panting Janey appeared at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Andy, are you okay? You weren&amp;rsquo;t picking up your phone, but I heard that there had been some parcel delivery scams
recently…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the wide-open door,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey first looked at Alice lying unconscious on the floor, and then at me squatting next to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then she hesitated and changed her words, &amp;ldquo;What happened here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;15&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hurriedly explained that I just left my phone in the bedroom to charge, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t pick up the call, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t
encountered any parcel scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did I trouble you for nothing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey shook her head, &amp;ldquo;No, I just overthought it. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After helping me get Alice on the couch, Janey said goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re fine now, then I&amp;rsquo;ll be leaving.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed her to the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as soon as she stepped out, she turned back and asked, &amp;ldquo;If I may ask, who is… she to you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was obviously referring to Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s always a little strange to have an ex-girlfriend suddenly drop by unannounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want my personal relationships to become office gossip, so I lied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She is my cousin, she had a fight with her parents and ran away from home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey looked at the suitcase by the door, as if heaved a sigh of relief, and laughed, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s just how kids are
during puberty, they always run away at the drop of a hat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sending Janey away and closing the door, I realized that the person on the couch had waken up at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was staring at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Andy, who is your &amp;lsquo;sister&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo;
Her voice was hoarse from the fever and her body was weak, but she stubbornly propped herself up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And also, who is that woman, your new girlfriend, did you get together with her to spite me, or do you really like
her now…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her breathing was somewhat chaotic, her eyelashes drooped like fans, casting a little shadow on her face,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like an abandoned puppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I avoided her gaze and didn&amp;rsquo;t look at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Trespassing is against the law. If you leave now, I won&amp;rsquo;t call the police.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stubbornly stared at me, stood up and asked again, &amp;ldquo;Is that woman your new girlfriend? Did you come to Atlanta for her?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had lost some weight, her small face seemed even paler and more fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stepped back and cleared the way to the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying, &amp;ldquo;Yes, I really like her, so your current actions drastically interfere with my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it, you&amp;rsquo;re lying.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a look of sorrow in her eyes, and her voice was trembling almost imperceptibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I smiled, raised the corner of my mouth and looked at her, &amp;ldquo;Why should I lie to you, Alice, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually
think that you are important, would you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even someone like you, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, costs at least five thousand to keep for a month. I leached off you for three
years, so I&amp;rsquo;d better be nice to you…or did you misunderstand and really think that I liked you that much?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman in front of me instantly turned pale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her emotional eyes turned from sorrow to disbelief, and finally, to anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood inside, watching her drag her luggage away in shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;rsquo;t even look back when she went downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I picked up my phone from the table, cut off the call and replied to the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s gone, she probably won&amp;rsquo;t come back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They replied immediately, &amp;ldquo;We heard everything. Thanks for your cooperation, Mr. Andy. The video has been destroyed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A declaration followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stating that if the video were to be leaked in the future, they would be fully responsible and would have to pay
substantial damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t look, I just deleted the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I squatted on the ground with cold hands and feet, covering my face with my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received the message while I was on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris contacted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sent me a video, a video of the past that I thought no one would ever see,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording my most embarrassing, most unforgettable past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in college, my first part-time job was actually at a bar as a receptionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drunk man asked me to show him the way to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was young at the time and had no experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was just showing him the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we turned the corner of the corridor, he suddenly leaned in and started touching me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I realized that some men could…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned for a moment before I came back to my senses. I fought back frantically, shouting that I was going to
call the police. The man woke up sober and cursed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Darn it, why are you acting?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afraid I would call the police,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took out five thousand dollars and threw it in front of me, telling me to not make a fuss about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just enough to cover my tuition for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gave me the confidence to quit my job at the bar, avoid working night shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allowed me to stop scrambling for tuition for at least a year, take on fewer part-time jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allowed me to focus on studying, work hard to win a scholarship, and find a more leisurely part-time job in my
spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back to school, I brainwashed myself insistently, saying, &amp;ldquo;After all, I am a man, it&amp;rsquo;s okay, five thousand
is not a small amount, it&amp;rsquo;s a blessing in disguise, anyway, I will never go back to that place again, and I will never see that man…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a lot of showers that day after I returned to my dorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, for a long time. Every time I see a middle-aged male who is wearing glasses and is overweight, I feel nauseated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Knock knock knock&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone was knocking at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was startled out of my thoughts, and called out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flash delivery, you have a delivery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delivery man in his uniform was holding a large bunch of sunflowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language of sunflowers is: belief, brilliance, pride, loyalty, sunlight, brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It signifies silent love, love that is hearty and unstoppable, where one can bravely pursue what they want…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also delivered with the flowers,was a letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter of apology handwritten by Alice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brother, this is a letter that I wrote long ago but didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to give to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry, I did not want to agree to Amy&amp;rsquo;s plan to revenge you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought she was childish and foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it was unnecessary to bully an innocent person this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I chose to reject her from the moment she proposed me this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tried to persuade and beg me, but I just ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until one night, we had a reunion and Amy took everyone to the coffee shop where you were part-timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was going to make trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get involved, so I stayed in the car and waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the glass of the coffee shop, I saw them shouting at you and deliberately throwing coffee on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the first time I saw you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought you would endure it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like a regular victim,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You calmly asked her to pay, not only for laundry and cleaning, but also for mental distress, and you mentioned that
the shop had surveillance and that you would call the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy was stunned by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprised at how different you were from what I had imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally understanding why Amy was so against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat in the car enjoying the show, very interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until you were indiscriminately scolded by the manager and lost your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You walked out of the coffee shop with your head held high, like a proud gladiator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I, sitting in the car, knew that you were feeling wronged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rolled down the car window, wanting to ask if you were alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you just walked past me, muttering under your breath, &amp;ldquo;These bad guys, none of them will have flavor packs in
their instant noodles in the future!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were gritting your teeth with anger, but you had no intention of giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from that moment on, I suddenly felt that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if I were to pursue you, maybe Amy would stop bothering you, which seemed not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I agreed with Amy&amp;rsquo;s request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To approach and understand you, without revealing my identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because every time you glanced over, my heart raced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three years we spent together,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;were the happiest, but also the most painful days of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I loved you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I lied to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the longer it dragged on, the more painful it became.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even fantasized that if things go on long enough, then you and Amy would forget each other, and the lie would resolve itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was wrong again, because lies aren&amp;rsquo;t worn away with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer it drags on, the harder it is to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until everything came to light, you knew who I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized what a foolish mistake I had made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I really did realize I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brother, can you forgive me, and give me another chance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sir, could you please sign for this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was brought back to reality by the reminder in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After signing, I took the bouquet of flowers and put it at the foot of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The once cramped and gloomy rental room seemed to be bathed in a beam of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my vision was blurred by tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only feeling that the distant brightness was becoming increasingly unreachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve never been from the same world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is the dazzling star, radiant in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She would not stoop to compromising for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t care about that video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s my past, although not glamorous,but it was the best choice that I, in those days, made after weighing the pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if that video really got released, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cause any harm to me under the current circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just an ordinary person, I don&amp;rsquo;t live off the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the issue gets out, my company or colleagues might criticize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can resign and find a new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the adult world, while reputation and others&amp;rsquo; opinions are indeed important, strong work abilities and inner
strength are the foundations of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid of that video being released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just that Chris&amp;rsquo; phone call reminded me once again, that Alice and I have never been from the same world from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met and depended on each other when we were at our lowest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, we are not the same&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;17&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got Chris&amp;rsquo;s message, I was still on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone vibrated, alerted me of a new incoming message,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr Andy, there are some things I think you should know. Do you have time for a call?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a strange number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was a scam message and ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other side immediately followed up with a sentence, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about Alice, I&amp;rsquo;m Chris.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what Chris is trying to achieve by contacting me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually found a quiet place and took the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said I didn&amp;rsquo;t deserve Alice because of my background, a marriage of affluent families would be the most stable scenario, and even if I insist on staying with Alice, I could only be the third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, he told me that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, after I offended Amy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she initially thought of as a way to revenge, was not so childish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up with a silver spoon in her mouth, a lady who had been spoiled by her family, rich and powerful, arrogant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being beaten up and losing face, she went crazy wanting revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating me alone cost a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, she promised a handsome reward to anyone who could dig up dirt on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my surveillance footage from the bar, taking money from a man,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow got into her hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy was ecstatic and ready to post the video online, along with my personal information and professional name in a popular school network and Tieba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Male university student prostitutes for money, client is same-sex.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a headline she had prepared long before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was enough to ruin my reputation, and if the news got big enough, I could potentially be expelled by the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Alice who stopped her, telling her that she shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ruin other people&amp;rsquo;s lives because of her unintentional mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy naturally disagreed and directly refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what Alice said about the possibility that she could get into trouble if the victim reports to the police, made her somewhat wary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She began to hesitate about whether to release the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when she saw those girls who sent love letters to Alice, and looked disappointed after being rejected, suddenly she had an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;ldquo;Alice, how about you help me get revenge? You go after that poor boy, and when he falls in love with you, you brutally break up with him, he will be heartbroken.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I promise, as long as you help me get revenge, I will do whatever you ask in the future!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Alice wrote in her letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, she refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Amy&amp;rsquo;s persistent pressure on me made her a little reluctant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when this outrageously long, three-year-long revenge plot began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Alice truly fell for me, she began to delay the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Amy, came to urge her to act quickly, Alice would say that I was not affectionate enough about her, and needed more time to build up feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as spring turns to autumn, the seasons change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whole three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the foolish Amy finally realized something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night was Alice&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, Chris attended the event and he was embarrassed by the event organizer, Amy&amp;rsquo;s car skills were average, she pleaded with Alice to go to the event venue with her to back up Chris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t occur to her that in the car, while Amy was negotiating with the event organizer, she was photographed by someone because of her attractive looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video hit the trending list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Chris&amp;rsquo;s team, without considering the facts, they amplified the heat for publicity, and it got hotter and hotter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice was extremely anxious, fearing that if I saw it, I would misunderstand her relationship with Chris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hurriedly tried to suppress the trending list, trying to ban the video across the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Amy sensed something unusual from her rare outburst of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She questioned who Alice was suppressing the trending list for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did she fall for me, and that&amp;rsquo;s why she refuses to break up with me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, that video climbed to the top of the hot list and was sent to me by Jhonny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice was in a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she didn&amp;rsquo;t dare to admit it in front of Amy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because she was afraid that Amy, without considering the consequences, would do something improper to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, she could only break up with me in front of Amy, and brought Amy to me, hoping that after the play was over,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy would be satisfied and would no longer harass me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Chris was much smarter than Amy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She saw that Alice was helpless,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And took advantage of it, threatened her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mu family started as a supermarket business, with a large family business, very rich, but in recent years the market is not promising, plus the impact of e-commerce on the real economy, the business is slowly going downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain the family glory and try to transform the business with the help of Alice&amp;rsquo;s family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He proposed to get engaged with Alice, a business marriage, for half a year, the two do not need real love, just need to maintain the title of engagement quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the chip is that piece of surveillance footage, and Amy can never get close to me again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surveillance footage from that year had been erased long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris, with the last backup in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after she finished everything, she found out she had been blacklisted by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she forced herself to stay focused on acting in front of Amy and relatives and friends and waited until all these things were resolved before going to find me to explain everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that I would leave directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She never drinks, but she was drunk many times during that period, when she was sober she would drive back to the rental house, staring at the window I used to live in until the light came on and then went out, and she would leave after the curtain was pulled open after dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that night, she waited for the whole night, but still couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait for the light to come on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thought I had an accident, but ran upstairs only to find out I had already left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landlord was cleaning up the room, picking through the things I left behind, trying to keep the useful ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clothes and shoes I bought for her were all pulled out and thrown on the ground, it was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She teared up, squatting in the room crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landlord was startled by her, and the neighbors almost called the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she calmed herself down, told the landlord that she was willing to pay for these sundries, and rented the room at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all known to Amy when she finds Alice missing and looks for her from the landlord&amp;rsquo;s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the phone, Chris&amp;rsquo;s voice is cold and low, &amp;ldquo;Mr Andy, do you know, Alice always dislikes me, dislikes us who sell our marriages for the family business, for profit, but for you, for that surveillance, she still agreed to my request, got engaged with me, don&amp;rsquo;t you find it ironic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;From a profit perspective, Alice and I are the most suitable marriage combination, she is smart and I don&amp;rsquo;t dislike her, this marriage can promote the cooperation between two families, she can also get the approval of her parents faster with the help of my family, and inherit the family business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She likes you a lot and has done a lot for you, but what about you, what have you done for her? What can you do for her? I heard that you can&amp;rsquo;t even afford to buy a house now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I did lie, I meticulously planned that engagement ceremony, planning to turn the fake into real, thinking if her brain was a little bit sober, she should realize that it would be the most cost-effective to get married to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But because of you, she lost even her rationality, caused a commotion at the engagement ceremony, became a laughing stock in the whole circle, and stubbornly went to find you to explain, which even annoyed her family, a not so smart heir, even with blood relations, can lose inheritance rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is difficult for her, a woman, to inherit the family business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr Andy, do you want to ruin everything for her?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was silent for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to, and I can&amp;rsquo;t bear to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have to remain cold and drive her away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to the present moment and watched those flowers for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So long that my eyes were sore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then reluctantly switched off the lights, and watched the dark engulf that beam of light, everything returned to silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following days, I was not feeling well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the preparation for the expo had reached the final stage where the brand vehicles were entering the site, which was relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I was absent-minded the whole time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t make any mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I hoped to go off work and go home to rest as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was going upstairs, I found the door of the next room open, with quite a lot of luggage at the door, including a pink suitcase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous tenant moved out just last week, and new tenants moved in today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound insulation of the house was not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the tenants this time won&amp;rsquo;t quarrel at midnight like the couple before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking like this, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but take a few more glances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I felt familiar with the pink suitcase at the next door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An uneasy premonition suddenly rose in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next second, a person walked out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, black hair pushed to one side, revealing Alice&amp;rsquo;s delicate and beautiful face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was about to bend down to move things, and it felt strange to see her standing in an old, narrow residential building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So surprised that I forgot to pull the key that I had stuck halfway in, &amp;ldquo;Why are you still here, didn&amp;rsquo;t you leave?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice straightened up on hearing this and looked at me, &amp;ldquo;I was planning to leave, but I upset my boyfriend and she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go home with me, so I had to do everything to win her over until she changed her mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she said this, her eyes fixed on my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hearing what she had to say, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, she also didn&amp;rsquo;t wait for my answer, saying, &amp;ldquo;Okay, looking at your dark circles, I know you didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep well, hurry back to rest, when I finish tidying up here, I will invite you to my housewarming feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s as a neighbor, your girlfriend won&amp;rsquo;t mind, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of being sick, her voice was a little hoarse, and her beautiful eyes were full of laughter, just like the first time we met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she rode a bicycle to catch up with me, the sun shining on her face, the teasing voice mixed with the wind, &amp;ldquo;Classmate, you read while walking, are you sure you won&amp;rsquo;t bump into a tree?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did I respond at that time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said no, but the next second, I almost hit a street light because I was distracted by her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stopped the bike and laughed at me on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice was still looking at me as if waiting for my answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pressed down the strange heartbeat, shifted my gaze, and said coldly, &amp;ldquo;No need, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the habit of making friends with strangers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She should go back to her world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;19&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice moved next to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, she often came to knock on my door for some inexplicably strange little things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &amp;ldquo;Where to get WiFi?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What to do if the access control can&amp;rsquo;t be brushed?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the contact number for bucket water?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many times, I knew that she had ulterior motives, so I just ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or attitude cold, trying to quit her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if she has resolved her contradictions with her parents, I have no position to ask, so I can only worry blindly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after she moved in, the originally dim hallway became brighter and brighter day by day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several more shelves on the stairs, with various ornaments and colorful dolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even saw a ceramic flower pot on the shoe rack at her door, with a sunflower in it, facing the only small window in the hallway, blooming wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the flower seems to have not been watered for several days, and it is a bit wilting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, is she thinking about it and going home…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you thinking, Andy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My shoulder was patted, and when I came back to my senses, I realized it was Victor, he said with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The last day of the car show is tomorrow, we start to have a holiday from the day after tomorrow, five days in a row, Andy, do you have any plans then.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rubbed my neck and said, &amp;ldquo;I guess I will sleep for a day and a night first.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I guess so, it&amp;rsquo;s tough to keep an eye on the scene every day at seven o&amp;rsquo;clock.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the coming holiday, the small group members who have been working continuously for a month have visibly become excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon activities ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean up the site, sort out the materials, and finally take a group photo, and all is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off from work and returned home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped my bag and collapsed on the bed, just tired and listless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was about to fall asleep, my phone suddenly rang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a call from Johnny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only remembered then that he said he was coming to Atlanta this weekend, so I hurried to pick up the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, Old Jhonny, what date did you buy your flight ticket?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the person on the phone was surprisingly excited, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the ticket later, have you seen the hot search? Chris announced to quit the entertainment industry and also got married.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing Jhonny&amp;rsquo;s words, I became slightly awake, subconsciously gripped my phone, and asked, &amp;ldquo;When did this happen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A few days ago someone was revealing it, but not many people believed, the fans were all over the place to debunk the rumors that Chris was on the rise of his career and would not leave the circle, but a moment ago, the studio directly announced it, even showed the marriage certificate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marriage certificate…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subconsciously repeated these three words, feeling mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after getting off work, when I saw that pot of flowers, I was guessing that she really gave up and had gone back to New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But right now, when the guess was confirmed, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel as relaxed as I had imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I felt as if a big stone was pressing on my chest and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t catch my breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But actually, this is exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rejected her coldly, precisely to make her leave and return to the world where she should be…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhonny is still talking on the other end of the phone, but I can&amp;rsquo;t listen to a word right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just interrupted him and said, &amp;ldquo;Old Jhonny, I have something here, why don&amp;rsquo;t I call you when I&amp;rsquo;m done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright, I just got off work and need to rush for the subway, we can talk when I get home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hung up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rental house was quiet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how long I had been lying on the bed, watching the sky outside the window gradually darken, and a bird flew past in the hazy evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, the door was knocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out of bed in a daze to answer the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unexpectedly, I saw Alice through the peephole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had cut her hair short, and without the cover of long hair, her completely exposed neck looked even more slender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this person doing here again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to reconcile with your ex after getting married and want to get my blessing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed feelings, I opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she flashed the ingredients in her hand at me and said, &amp;ldquo;Do you want to come to my house for hot pot, I promised to invite you to dinner after moving in.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No need, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to eat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she still didn&amp;rsquo;t give up, &amp;ldquo;Why, you&amp;rsquo;re really afraid that your girlfriend will be unhappy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her tone was still teasing, and even my good temper was out of patience, &amp;ldquo;Alice, what do you mean, since you are married, can you not bother me anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hearing this, Alice was stunned, &amp;ldquo;What are you talking about, who can I marry besides you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She doesn&amp;rsquo;t know when to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply pulled out my phone, clicked on the hot search, and looked for evidence for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, Johnny didn&amp;rsquo;t lie to me at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#ChrisRetires and #ChrisGetsMarried, hashtags firmly dominated the hot search list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clicked on one at random, found the picture of the marriage certificate, and prepared to show Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after magnifying it, I found something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recognize the woman on this marriage certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look closely at the name column, it&amp;rsquo;s not written Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can this happen…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m stunned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;20&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice leaned in to look at my phone screen, exhaled in relief, and said helplessly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you think I married Chris?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t answer, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t occur to me until then that Johnny had indeed told me about Chris&amp;rsquo;s marriage, but whether the bride was Alice or not, he didn&amp;rsquo;t mention…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing this, I felt terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice laughed with bright eyes and patiently explained to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I did go back to New York yesterday and attended Chris&amp;rsquo;s wedding, but more importantly, to explain to my parents about your existence, how important you are to me, to dispel their misunderstandings, so that I can bring you home with dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chris just wanted a marriage alliance, he never liked me. I had to go along with his act because he had something on me, but now I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Remember, you said we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be together because we&amp;rsquo;re from different worlds, but you forgot that the moment I fell in love with you, I came to your world. I love this world so much and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, can you give me a chance? Don&amp;rsquo;t be in such a hurry to drive me away. When I&amp;rsquo;m not enough for you, you can send me away, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes were gentle and firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a lump in my throat as I spoke in a nasal voice, &amp;ldquo;Let me think about it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you make your own decisions without considering your girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s opinions?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She emphasized the word &amp;ldquo;girlfriend&amp;rdquo; with a playful light in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I remembered that I had lied to her earlier - I had told her that Janey was my girlfriend in a bid to make her leave, but she had found out that I was lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When did you find out?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was too attached to you, I wanted to see you one last time after being driven away, and I found out that this place has poor sound insulation, and someone&amp;rsquo;s dream talk was all about calling my name.. Moreover, Janey, despite living so close to you, would always separate from you after work…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that I had been exposed from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then it hit me, &amp;ldquo;Wait, how did you know where Janey lives?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a secret.&amp;rdquo; She smirked, revealing a victorious smile, and said, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s go, let&amp;rsquo;s go eat hot pot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yinyang style?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lattice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed her, arriving at her home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as soon as I walked in, I was taken aback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there were just too many familiar things in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the wardrobe mirror to the slippers and ornaments, they were all things that I had left to my landlord when I
moved out of my house in New York because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take them with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How did these things end up here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice had already entered the kitchen and had begun washing vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She awkwardly responded, &amp;ldquo;Had someone ship them over to save money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even this mattress?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the thin mattress of the rental room, I had always had poor sleep quality. At that time, after struggling for a long time, I bought a latex mattress for $500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had split the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was moving, I realized that the shipping cost of taking the mattress to Atlanta was quite steep, so I had to regretfully give it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Alice had brought everything over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping cost adds up to more than the original price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t possibly be about saving money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chuckled as she blushed, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t expose her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, something&amp;rsquo;s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she&amp;rsquo;s so rich, why did she pretend to be poor in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of this, I asked directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice coughed lightly and explained, &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t I boast to my family that I was not like the other trust fund kids, that I could finish college by working and studying hard, even forcing them to freeze my card? Later, I realized that I was wrong and regretted it too late, so I had to tough it out and work a part-time job. So, you may not believe me, but I was poor back then……&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone rang, interrupting our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked it up only to find out that it was Janey calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auto show was over, and the department was going to hold a celebration party. She asked when I was free to arrange a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m free these few days, just arrange it according to everyone else&amp;rsquo;s schedule.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting my answer, Janey swiftly hung up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I noticed that the sound of washing vegetables in the kitchen had long stopped and that a head was sneakily peeping out from the doorframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, I decided to tease her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I might have to have dinner with someone else tomorrow…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I could finish, she walked out directly, saying with a smug look on her face, &amp;ldquo;Now you have to report to me whenever you have a meal with someone, proves that I&amp;rsquo;m on your mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold back my laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was someone who still held me in her heart despite having seen my coldest side; it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to tease her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a summer night in Atlanta, I had a hot pot with Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She loved the spicy hot pot but could barely talk through the spice,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she filled the whole balcony with sunflowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcoming me into her world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janey - Extra Story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Janey, and I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m being followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work, I went grocery shopping as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But walking on the road, there&amp;rsquo;s always a strange feeling of being watched behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look back, there&amp;rsquo;s no one to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be arranged by the competing company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our company has the opportunity to collaborate with the government on a car show, which is not an easy thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few similar-sized competitors have been eager to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;ve been creating chaos since the project started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking, threats, reports, and all sorts of small moves are common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the car show is less than half a month away, I want to see what they want to do this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of this, I changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t go grocery shopping anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I changed my route and went to a tea restaurant nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to this tea restaurant a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no private rooms, the table layout is clear, and it&amp;rsquo;s all transparent glass, which is convenient for observing the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, I had just sat down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, a person wearing all black and a hat and mask peeked through the glass window into the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s a woman, judging from her figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taller than me, with a good figure, but aren&amp;rsquo;t men usually the ones doing the tracking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid frightening her, I pretended not to notice her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered food as usual, giving off the impression of a person resolving dinner alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as time went on, after finishing my meal, I even ordered a pot of tea, while drinking and taking out my notebook, dealing with unfinished work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, she ran out of patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pushed the door and came in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiter greeted her and asked where she wanted to sit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her gaze was always staring at me lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when she was led by the waiter and passed by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out and grabbed her sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her body stiffened, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t dare to look back at me, she just stared at the ground and questioned, &amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then realized that her voice was soft, she seemed to be quite young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nervousness after being caught red-handed was visually obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably just an intern who has been bamboozled by her boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She softened her tone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing, I just want to share a table with you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, she was unhappy, struggling to shake me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiter who didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what was happening also interjected, &amp;ldquo;Madam, there are plenty of seats in the shop now, you two don&amp;rsquo;t need to share a table.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I felt a connection with this young lady at first sight, I wanted to get to know her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And, you&amp;rsquo;ve been following me for so long, I should know who you are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After saying this, the person was stiffened and looked up at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She directly took off her mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing a young and pretty face, with thick long eyelashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiter next to her was stunned, then murmured under her breath, &amp;ldquo;She must be a celebrity, no wonder she&amp;rsquo;s so wrapped up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I thought this person looked familiar……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the other party calmly sat across from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then remembered where I had seen her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are Andy&amp;rsquo;s cousin?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one called Alice……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other party had been lowering her head, ordering from the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard this, she looked up a bit disgruntled, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not his cousin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frowned, recalling the scene I saw when I arrived at Andy&amp;rsquo;s house that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So who are you? Why are you following me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;rsquo;t answer, just kept ordering what she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waited until the waiter noted down the menu and left, then she spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staring at me and asking, &amp;ldquo;Do you like Andy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you asking this for?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I was also asking myself, do I like Andy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I ran into Andy again was in early April when the specific time of the car show had been determined, but because it was the first time the branch company was running such a level of exhibition, they lacked experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the interference from competitors, the exhibition plans of several cooperating brands have not been finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progress took time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then did I report to the New York head office for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head office was very efficient and quickly organized an online meeting to impart experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was responsible for the liaison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle and high levels of the branch company were all present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that the speaker on the large screen after the connection was a handsome young boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked a few years younger than me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the image was severely inconsistent with expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of discussion in the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also a bit puzzled, we had agreed that it would be explained by experienced veterans, how did they suddenly change to a rookie at the last minute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even so, the order of the meeting still needs to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to speak out and ask everyone to quiet down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the boy on the opposite side was probably not able to keep the meeting going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I had a chance to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a voice on the other side, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s save some time, you guys have too many questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voice was crisp and cool, and he pulled up the PPT that had been prepared a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not shy at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even facing the Editor&amp;rsquo;s intentionally difficult questions, he still maintained modesty and politeness, saying, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand how this question relates to event planning, but I believe your question should have a deeper meaning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editor blushed, but could not refute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was a mean and stingy person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone had suffered a lot from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the Editor being teased, there was a light laughter in the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsequent meeting progress was also exceptionally smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I, also have a bit of admiration for the boy on the other side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online meeting ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disconnected the computer and projection connection, waiting for everyone in the office to leave one by one, also packed up my things, ready to go off work for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that there would suddenly be some noise coming from the computer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And mixed with some unclear dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I remembered that after the meeting, the connection should have been forgotten to cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a habit of not shutting down the computer, I just closed the notebook straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I wanted to remind the other side to disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was caught off guard when I heard the speaking voice suddenly clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person should have brought the computer into the bathroom and called a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, Old Song, I finally finished the meeting!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know, I was tricked by the leader, he&amp;rsquo;s too lazy to have a meeting, so he threw it to me, and said it was a small meeting with two or three people, turns out a large group of people was on the other side, I was scared to death.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah! No way, I&amp;rsquo;m too pathetic, gotta have a piece of cake as a reward for myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accent was familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The originally calm and professional boy completely changed his demeanor, his voice lively and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to disturb him, so I just shut down the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after that, oddly enough, I would always remember that guy who had such a huge gap between when he was in public and when he was alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making mental preparations, I then made a call to a colleague who had been transferred to the head office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked who that boy was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colleague was very smart, and after laughing loudly, mercilessly pierced through my slight infatuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Carla, he has a girlfriend, and they have a good relationship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting this answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a bit disappointed, but it was within my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of adults is busy, the requirements that keep changing and the endless meetings are enough to bury that little infatuation under exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost forgot about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of May, I received a message from the leader again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that as the car show was approaching, they were short of hands, and the head office would dispatch an experienced person to assist me in completing the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to refuse outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re short-staffed, and we should be able to recruit new people after borrowing from other departments and getting busy for a while. But now that someone is parachuting in, not to mention whether they are adapting to the company&amp;rsquo;s pace, the top-down integration alone is not an easy task. The leader muttered, &amp;ldquo;This person originally said he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t come, he thought Atlanta was too far away, but now he seems to have broken up with his girlfriend and agreed.&amp;rdquo; Then, I saw the information. The boy on the resume had a decent look, but I was stunned. Also called Andy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing in the leader&amp;rsquo;s office, I can&amp;rsquo;t help thinking of the local accents I heard through the conference software. When I saw his former residence again, I finally remembered that boy who had been buried in the memory of a small city for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the age of twelve, my parents divorced, and I followed my dad back to my hometown. The small city is idyllic, but it also naturally rejects outsiders. I felt this more clearly. At that age, children who are a bit special are always hard to make friends with. So I often wandered around alone. But one day in the alley, I was targeted by a stray dog. I was so scared that I didn&amp;rsquo;t dare to go home and almost starved to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I met him. He saved me and also became the first friend I made. Meeting again after many years. I think it&amp;rsquo;s amazing and exciting. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but marvel at the cleverness of fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I held down my emotions and agreed to the headquarters&amp;rsquo; plan to transfer someone over. My boss thought I was making a forced compromise, and solemnly promised not to treat me badly. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t care at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the day before he arrived. The person who was originally arranged to pick up the plane was Victor. But his cat was going to give birth, and the timing was conflicting. I directly approved his leave and offered to pick him up tomorrow. Victor didn&amp;rsquo;t expect me to be so swift, quietly told Steven that Carla, who was hanging high above her affairs, had turned her sex. I laughed. Also aware that I was a bit despicable. But, when the feeling of a heartbeat comes, isn&amp;rsquo;t it really stupid not to try to seize it? I went to the airport and saw him. He seemed to be in low spirits and greeted me politely and awkwardly. I tried to make him laugh. He smiled, his guard melted away a lot, but he still couldn&amp;rsquo;t recognize me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind, I&amp;rsquo;m not in a hurry either. Afterward, he officially joined the company and we became colleagues. The closer I got, the more I realized that he was a shining boy. And every time, when I remember the surprised and blank expression when I gave him candy, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but raise my lips. Suddenly, my desk was knocked on by someone. I recovered, listening to the person across me repeating her question. &amp;ldquo;Do you like Andy at all?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What does it have to do with you?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t ask, answer me yes or no.&amp;rdquo; The person opposite was full of energy, with obvious hostility. For some reason, I always feel that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give in at this time, hands crossed to meet her gaze, &amp;ldquo;What if it is?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person opposite gave me an annoyed look and said, &amp;ldquo;I advise you to give up as soon as possible, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like people like you.&amp;rdquo; This got me laughing, &amp;ldquo;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t like people like me, does he like people like you?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Yes, you guessed it right.&amp;rdquo; The person on the other side took off her hat and looked at me provocatively. Even as a female, I have to admit she is very beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I faintly remembered Victor mentioning that Andy was believed to have been deeply hurt by his ex, who cheated on him, and every time Andy brought up the topic, his mood would worsen. I looked at the girl in front of me with a complicated expression and suddenly made a guess, &amp;ldquo;Are you Andy&amp;rsquo;s ex?&amp;rdquo; On hearing this, she refuted a little unhappily, &amp;ldquo;Temporarily, temporarily ex.&amp;rdquo; I squinted my eyes, no longer tone gentle, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not quite appropriate to still harass him after breaking up.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to harass him.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;So what does it mean to follow me, force me to give up, so he has to forgive you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My words probably hit the nail on the head. The person&amp;rsquo;s eyes were dimming, she bit her lip. After a long time, she finally spoke slowly, &amp;ldquo;Sorry, I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to bother you, I&amp;rsquo;m just here today to confirm, if he&amp;rsquo;s really with you.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;If you guys are together, and he likes you, then I want to find out what kind of person you are, if you&amp;rsquo;re a good person, then I&amp;rsquo;ll choose to bless you and leave directly.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;And if you&amp;rsquo;re not together, I have to know what kind of person you are. I&amp;rsquo;ve wronged him, I want to do everything I can to get him back, so I always need to know my enemy and know myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person opposite was serious, with a determined look in her eyes. Females are the best at discerning whether the other is lying or not. I&amp;rsquo;m a little surprised, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect her to be so honest, and brave to be honest. And this person doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like the type to cheat. Victor&amp;rsquo;s intelligence is probably wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the army to spy on the situation, &amp;ldquo;how did you break up?&amp;rdquo; She raised her head, and her eyes wrote the three words &amp;lsquo;wishful thinking&amp;rsquo;. After a sip of tea, she counter-questioned, &amp;ldquo;How did you know Andy&amp;rsquo;s home address?&amp;rdquo; The eyes met and both fell silent. I secretly concluded that this girl was very careful, and a tough opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it dragged on until the tea restaurant was about to close, and the waiter came over to chase people. Because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear any enemy news from her, I was somewhat disappointed. Suggested tentatively, &amp;ldquo;Shall we find a place to sit?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s go.&amp;rdquo; The person opposite agreed very happily, obviously with the same idea as me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I left the tea house. I began to think about where to take her. Atlanta&amp;rsquo;s nights are never afraid of being late, especially with such a large square nearby. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s almost noon now, the square is still very lively, with endless food, drink, and fun stalls, and from time to time a cartoon car comes over, with the laughter of children. I was checking Yelp on my phone, but someone came over to greet me. It was a little girl with a publicity flyer, smiling with a mouthful of white teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Two beauties, our new store is opening, we are now holding a balloon game, following the official account can get darts, and participate in the prizes, do you want to try?&amp;rdquo; I waved my hand, intending to refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the young person introduced it so enthusiastically, I finally took a glance in the direction she pointed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not far away, there was a temporary stage set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle were three huge targets, covered with countless tiny colored balloons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to the targets, there was a whole wall of plush toys, set up as rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people participated in the activity, and the top row of toys was almost all taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last left on that row was a bright yellow sunflower doll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that Andy&amp;rsquo;s WeChat profile picture seems to be this doll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I win it and give it to him…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where is the QR code, I want to participate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was still thinking, Alice&amp;rsquo;s voice sounded from behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling alarmed, only one thought left in my mind: I can&amp;rsquo;t let her get ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly scanned the QR code as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both rushed to collect darts and lined up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young girl was a bit dumbfounded, not understanding why the two of us, who weren&amp;rsquo;t enthusiastic at first, became so eager all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person gets ten darts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to hit more than five to get the soft toy; otherwise, you only get a keychain as a souvenir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her target and mine are the last remaining sunflower dolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve thrown darts this seriously in my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But fortunately, heaven rewards the diligent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won the doll ahead of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the way, Alice stared at the doll in my hand angrily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You, an adult, snatched a toy from a child who wanted it. Is it so deserved to win?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m in a good mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m willing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we sat down for a drink, both of them had a strong will to win, fighting each other fiercely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then they both got drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Miss Jiang, it seems you&amp;rsquo;re drunk. Maybe you should stop drinking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though I said this my tolerance isn&amp;rsquo;t great either. I&amp;rsquo;m barely holding on, just refusing to give in to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not drunk, it&amp;rsquo;s just hot here, and my face is a bit red.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is still stubborn, standing up and saying she needs to go to the restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, she was being sneaky. She made a round from the side, approached from my back, and tried to steal the doll I hid under the chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caught stealing, she sheepishly returned to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your reaction is very fast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but tease her, &amp;ldquo;If you can&amp;rsquo;t win, you try to steal, isn&amp;rsquo;t that a bit mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With her head down guiltily, her face, already flushed, turned even redder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But Andy likes it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these words, she suddenly stood up and banged her hand on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry! It was mean of me. We agreed to a fair competition. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have stolen your toy!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was so loud that many people in the bar turned to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a socially awkward scene happened next, but it was even harder for me to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I also stood up and patted her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praised her loudly, &amp;ldquo;Well said! You may not be as pretty as me, but you have a good character!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I am prettier than you, I am much more good-looking than you, let&amp;rsquo;s compete.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s do it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up the next day, the video I found on my phone was of two women, completely intoxicated, appearing on the screen, struggling to keep their faces as far away from the screen as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You stand in the front, otherwise my face looks enlarged.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No way, your face is already big, doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you stay in the front.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passer-by filmed looked entertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collapsed while clutching my messy hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only then did I realize how much drinking could make a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only saving grace was that we didn&amp;rsquo;t go completely insane and sent this video to Andy to judge who was more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I still remember on my way home with Alice, she seemed to have cried, deeply intoxicated, but kept repeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she was sincerely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hoped for forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her voice was sincere, and I was somewhat moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to hand over the person I like because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair competition is the greatest respect for the opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when the exhibition ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night before the vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called Andy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to ask him out for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the call got through, I was sweating in my palms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still tried to stay calm and asked him, &amp;ldquo;When are you free, can we have a meal together?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sure, I&amp;rsquo;m free these days.&amp;rdquo; The person on the phone was happy, but he asked me, &amp;ldquo;Is it a company celebration banquet, can I bring a friend along?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was startled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a hurry, I changed my tone and said, &amp;ldquo;Yes, a celebration banquet, the auto show was a great success, everyone has worked hard, so let&amp;rsquo;s celebrate together. When we decide on the exact time, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask Victor to inform you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His tone was relaxed, and we chatted for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in that chat, there was only the friendliness between colleagues, without any trace of affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the call ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood in the corridor, staring at the small sunflower outside Alice&amp;rsquo;s door for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understood for the first time what it meant to win the game but lose the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but laugh, and then I took out the sunflower doll that I had been carrying in my shopping bag all the way, and placed it next to the flower pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, at least there will be no regrets after trying, it would be embarrassing if I didn&amp;rsquo;t even try.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 17:04:16 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/beyond-earths-core/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*uaf7Mg2UclegdKD44FInNw.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Beyond Earth’s core" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientific accident has led us to discover the remains of a deity deep underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created a drill head made of a high-temperature-resistant alloy, dressed in a protective suit as heavy as a spacesuit, and drilled in a designated uninhabited area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After drilling two thousand meters deep, the exploration team leader found magma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the magma was enveloped a segment of stark white bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this that had destroyed the cutting machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place originally was China&amp;rsquo;s Jinping Underground Laboratory, located two thousand four hundred meters underground, it&amp;rsquo;s the deepest laboratory in the world that is used for dark matter research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean sat inside the isolation room, wordless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the one-way glass, I could observe him focusing his gaze on the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you looking at?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean, like a wind-up machine, his eyes wide open, rigidly turned his neck: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the cross.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The cross?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lowered my head to look at the surveillance footage, light was shining through the gap in the isolation room door, forming a long cross shadow on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Does it hold any special meaning?&amp;rdquo; I asked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know… I advise you to run away as quickly as you can. Escape from here, from this abyss back to the surface…
It&amp;rsquo;s not too late yet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sean,&amp;rdquo; I sighed and said, &amp;ldquo;I just parachuted in, everything is all dark in front of me, I need to know what happened here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean wanted to smoke, but I rejected him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A formerly cheerful and optimistic colleague who had suddenly turned into a living corpse, anyone would find unsettling. Sean lowered his head, hoarsely and slowly telling me his account of events…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an accidental collision experiment in 2011, we found a single photon existing, entangled with another photon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange thing is, that we could not find the other photon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the long-range action of the other photon reacted with the photon we were observing - it changed from a particle to a wave right under our eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make an inappropriate analogy: Wave-particle duality is like two blind boxes, inside which could be different or identical things. As long as we open one of them, the thing in the other blind box must invariably become the same as the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the long-range action of quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the situation we encountered at that time was more like we only saw one blind box, the other one was gone - the ball inside the blind box we saw suddenly changed into a square right under our eyelids, and without any external force influencing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, another observer emerged from the other blind box, and the physics of this world took it as the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its perspective, the thing inside the blind box is a square, so the other blind box - the photon we observed - also became a square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no longer just a matter of modern physics being unstable, more importantly, unknown intelligent lives exist on Earth, but we do not know where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At the time, that project was under my responsibility,&amp;rdquo; Sean said, &amp;ldquo;At the request of the state, I classified this discovery as a top secret. Since then, the state began to devote a lot of manpower and resources to seek the other &amp;lsquo;photon&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did you find it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, but we found the direction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Underground.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Sean led the research group to find the rough direction of the other photon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was right underneath the Jinping Underground Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a project far larger than the Kola Superdeep Borehole was launched stealthily. They hollowed out the entire mountain above the Jinping Underground Laboratory, leaving only a thin layer of ground. Then, they dismantled the Jinping Underground Laboratory and started digging downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each one thousand meters down, they had to expand the passage, build elevators, build buildings laterally, and build new laboratories; after confirming in the lab that the &amp;ldquo;photon&amp;rdquo; was still below, they would continue to dig down.
This project was a bottomless pit, constantly guzzling massive amounts of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2031, that is this year, this inverted triangle building had extended to thirty-five kilometers underground, nearing the bottom of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just when they were about to puncture through the crust and enter the mantle that an accident happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In previous experiments, there was always a strange &amp;lsquo;single photon&amp;rsquo; in an observation group. We may be maintaining a synchronic tacit agreement with another observer,&amp;rdquo; Sean paused and took a deep breath before continuing, &amp;ldquo;This means that, just like us, they have been always observing the photon - while we&amp;rsquo;re looking for them, they are also approaching us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you mean there are intelligent lifeforms underground?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; Sean shook his head, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the word &amp;rsquo;lifeform&amp;rsquo; applies to them - even tardigrades can only tolerate temperatures up to 150 degrees, but where we are, the temperature is as high as 967 degrees Celsius. Just stepping out of this building, we would be instantly roasted into a mummy - I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what kind of life could survive in such severe conditions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean&amp;rsquo;s words were too far-fetched, which made me start to consider other possibilities: &amp;ldquo;Could there be some special physical phenomena that haven&amp;rsquo;t been discovered yet?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There could have been, originally,&amp;rdquo; Sean&amp;rsquo;s face gradually distorted, he said with a laugh that was also like crying, &amp;ldquo;But not anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, the mantle is solid, but just to be safe, the geologists of the research group were well-prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They produced super high-temperature-resistant alloy drill heads, wore protective suits as heavy as spacesuits, and performed drilling in designated uninhabited areas. This was to collect samples to learn about the condition of the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After drilling two thousand meters deep, the exploration team leader David noticed something odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data stopped changing, and the temperature of the drill head no longer rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, the drill head should&amp;rsquo;ve punctured the lithosphere and entered the mantle, where the temperature would keep rising. Because the mantle is likely a fluid, the drill head being burned was within expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the strange thing was, the drill head was working normally, and the detected temperature remained constant at one thousand degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it kept going down, the data didn&amp;rsquo;t change at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David suspected the detector was damaged and decided to retrieve the drill head immediately. After an inspection, there was nothing wrong with the data, and the drill head had collected samples of the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluid magma had burned the inner tank of the drill head, so David had no choice but to forcibly dismantle it. They used a cutter to separate the inner tank and the solidified magma, then started to cut the magma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this process, the cutter was broken by a hard object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piece of stark white bone was encased in the magma, and it was that which broke the cutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We tried all means but couldn&amp;rsquo;t even separate a single molecule from that bone,&amp;rdquo; said Sean, with trembling hands,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That thing, merely by existing, has completely overturned the existing biology and physics.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just a bone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, more than one. During the subsequent collection process, we gradually completed the skeletal artifact. Then we increased the intensity of mining. You should know that mining at nearly a thousand degrees under the ground is as difficult as establishing a colony on Mars - but we succeeded and officially entered the mantle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean&amp;rsquo;s mood became very low, &amp;ldquo;According to the staff&amp;rsquo;s statements, the reconstructed biological skeleton is inexplicably strange. I saw the pictures, but it&amp;rsquo;s very hard for me to describe what it looks like. It&amp;rsquo;s like… like a monkey with wings… a snake with osteophytes full of spikes… an octopus with three heads… it&amp;rsquo;s simply God&amp;rsquo;s leftover work, the source of all chaos and distortion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought for a while and asked: &amp;ldquo;Is this the intelligent life we are looking for?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, it&amp;rsquo;s not, they are still within the scope of human observation. What we are looking for might be &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;God?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After completing the phase three predictions and unmanned construction, we created a &amp;lsquo;Mantle Submarine&amp;rsquo;, named&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Deeper&amp;rsquo;. You can think of it as a manned big drill with its nuclear power. David drove it personally, deep into the mantle. When he came back, he said he saw God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leaned forward: &amp;ldquo;What kind of God?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Jade Emperor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How is it certain to be it?&amp;rdquo; I asked in confusion, &amp;ldquo;No one has ever seen what a God looks like, how could David be
sure that what he saw was the so-called Jade Emperor?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know. In the subsequent, eight people took turns driving the Deeper into the mantle, each claimed to have seen a deity… there were well-known ones like God, Buddha, Jesus, and Odin, and there were also newly created evil gods like Cthulhu and Azathoth. Three days later, the base at the lowest level lost contact. Severe electromagnetic interference caused all probe machines to malfunction. I was not on the bottom floor at the time, I could only command remotely. But all I got from the radio were spooky and indistinct murmurings, plus sharp and piercing screams.&amp;rdquo;
Sean ceased the narration: &amp;ldquo;As you see, we confirmed that there are unknown and incomprehensible things inside the Earth, and then unknown factors caused the destruction of the research base at the lowest level.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did they all die?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go to the lowest level to see what exactly happened there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean argued against it. There was a horizontal structure for every thousand meters in this building, and each
structure had a person in charge. If he didn&amp;rsquo;t cooperate, no one would have the authority to enter the lowest level.
He called for me to isolate the second-to-last level immediately. Anyone who escaped from the bottom level needed to
be quarantined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know anything yet,&amp;rdquo; Sean said leaning into the one-way glass, his face ferocious, &amp;ldquo;You can escape now. Once you go in, it is an irretrievable abyss. Even to the farthest corner of the earth, they can catch up with you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I raised my eyebrows and asked in return: &amp;ldquo;Are you hiding something from me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I cannot say! You cannot know! It&amp;rsquo;s a meme contagion, you will be affected by them as soon as you hear or even know them, understand?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak for a while, then I decided: &amp;ldquo;If gods are living in the dark underground, then they are not some beings with supreme power and glory; if they are part of the world&amp;rsquo;s rules, then science will tame them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean fell into silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reported the situation upwards, the upper management approved my request, revoked Sean&amp;rsquo;s authority, and temporarily granted me a top-level authority ID card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ten-person special squad was temporarily conscripted. They escorted Sean and entered the elevator with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I inserted the ID card and entered the password, a thirty-second countdown started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elevator has dozens of seats, everyone sat down and buckled their seat belts. After the countdown ended, a strong sense of weightlessness came, making people feel dizzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are plummeting into hell,&amp;rdquo; Sean said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person in charge has the right to seal off a certain area in case of emergency, all staff had already signed a confidentiality agreement before they came down, and they would be awarded the medal of heroism posthumously by the State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if there is some force majeure happening at the bottom level, the stationed personnel there are probably all sacrificed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Sean immediately sealed off the bottom level, he didn&amp;rsquo;t even leave time for evacuation. Probably over two hundred people were locked inside, only a handful managed to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen minutes later, we arrived at the bottom level and changed into protective suits in the isolation room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big door slowly opened, and the emergency backup light in the corridor was extremely dim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were almost out of power, and this place would fall into darkness soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did you shut off the life support system?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean shook his head: &amp;ldquo;No, the first system to fail was the lighting system. All we could see on the monitor was lights going off one by one. In the dark, all communication equipment malfunctioned.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What about wired telephones, are they also not usable?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You probably don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand, let me demonstrate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean took a tactical flashlight from a soldier, he walked to a dark corner that the backup light couldn&amp;rsquo;t reach with the flashlight on - it was a triangle corner, Sean leaned against the wall and turned off the flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was swallowed by darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stood waiting for a few minutes, not seeing Sean take the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I asked with confusion: &amp;ldquo;Sean? Weren&amp;rsquo;t you going to demonstrate?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned on my flashlight and shone it towards that corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no one there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walls are sturdy, made of a special alloy, without any cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency lighting illuminates both walls, leaving only a dead zone in the middle untouched by the light beam, just big enough for an adult to stand in. As long as you step out from the corner of the room, you will be caught by the
emergency light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under these circumstances, Sean simply vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear, like a slippery snake, coils around my heart. I realize that Sean probably lied to me. He must have been one of the observers, present at the time of the incident. He understood the severity of the situation, escaped, and chose to seal this place as a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To figure out what was going on, I had two soldiers holding a nylon rope, one of them shut off the flashlight and walked into the dark corner just like Sean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rope was suspended in mid-air. When we started calling out to the soldiers, there was no response.
Another soldier tried to pull him out of the darkness, but even with the help of four or five people, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t pull the rope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had no other choice but to turn on the flashlight and shine it towards that dark corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only to see the other end of the rope embedded in the alloy wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swallowed a lump in my throat, the absurd scene before me temporarily halted my thought process. The place we were
in seemed unreal - a place where all known logic from the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface became void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next moment, the emergency lighting battery ran out and shut off simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flashlight began to malfunction and flickered for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darkness fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the light came back on, our path back had disappeared. All around were strange machinery and equipment, likely inside some laboratory at the bottom level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we found that in the short blink of darkness, three veteran special forces soldiers had disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quietly, unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, I roughly figured out the pattern of &amp;ldquo;human evaporation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as you are in the dark, you will be randomly transported to any place untouched by light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I entered this place, the flashlight had been flickering unstably, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a stable light source to ensure I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be randomly transported. Therefore, I experienced eight rounds of darkness, each time the flashlight came back on, I saw a strange environment, and I was separated from the soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this process, I saw half a corpse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of it was embedded in the wall, and half was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proves that the transport does not avoid obstacles, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible that the next time I fall into darkness, I could be transported into a load-bearing pillar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand the principle behind these phenomena, nor do I understand how these bizarre things are possible. It is this unknown that makes me more fearful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean was right. If this situation spreads to the upper buildings, the best action would be to escape as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building complex has turned into a giant maze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I was about to find an exit, the darkness would come as expected, taking me to a place even more strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a skeleton tens of meters high, covered with bone spikes, grotesque and terrifying, it&amp;rsquo;s unimaginable how shocking it was when it was alive;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw bodies &amp;ldquo;embedded&amp;rdquo; in the walls, the scariest being a ceiling with dozens of arms sticking out. It was probably a large-scale transport that sent several people into the wall at once;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw security doors twisted out of shape from impact, a hallway filled with dried blood and battle scars… Until the thirty-second move, I came to a familiar place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the door, at the glow of the crucifix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-sided glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the second last floor, my being able to be transported here meant the seal had failed, and that the special
situation was spreading upwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this moment, Sean&amp;rsquo;s warning echoed in my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even to the ends of the earth, they can catch up with you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light abruptly went out, and endless screams and howls came from all around. My eardrums were about to burst, my thoughts scattered, and my senses of the world became abstract and meshed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frantically scrambled in the dark, slapping the flashlight hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I tripped over something, banging my head hard on something solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels as if a steel needle has been jabbed into my head, causing unbearable pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My face also hurts, a burning kind of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaguely, I heard a blurred shout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you still conscious?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone was slapping my face hard. My consciousness gradually returned, but my brain was somewhat groggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It hurts…stop hitting…&amp;rdquo; I muttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It works!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person exclaimed delightedly, then continued to slap my face like a storm. I almost passed out from his slaps, so
I had to use all my strength to raise my hand and cover my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hang in there! Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by the evil god!&amp;rdquo; the person shouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m fine! Stop fu*king hitting me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sobered up and opened my eyes. The light around was dim, and a kerosene lamp was placed on the ground. My body armor had been taken off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man who was beating me was a man dressed like an Arab, wrapped tightly in a white bedsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this?&amp;rdquo; The man held up his middle finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is an internationally recognized gesture. Stop taking advantage of me, &amp;quot; I sat up, somewhat dazed, &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where am I?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man lifted the sheet covering his head to reveal a bearded face: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s me, David!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognized him. He was David, the head of the exploration project, a well-known geologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sean&amp;rsquo;s statement, I remembered that he was the first one to pilot the submersible into the mantle. I had subconsciously thought he was the first to die, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect him to still be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by the furnishings around us, we were in a small storage room. A simple hammock hung on the shelves, and the corner was filled with domestic garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David had been living here for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s going on upstairs?&amp;rdquo; David grasped my collar, &amp;ldquo;Why is the elevator sealed? Last week, I finally managed to enter the elevator, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start after entering the password.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was somewhat surprised: &amp;ldquo;Last week? I received the news yesterday and entered this afternoon, it&amp;rsquo;s only been two days… What&amp;rsquo;s this about last week?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the dim side light, I noticed David&amp;rsquo;s expression was extremely pained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He counter-asked: &amp;ldquo;How many times have you experienced darkness?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You mean being in a lightless environment? Seems like… thirty-three times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;You can still be alive, you can still maintain your sanity!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every time you&amp;rsquo;re in darkness, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t die on the spot or lose your mind, it means there&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;positive god&amp;rsquo; protecting you… but this protection is limited, it can only transport you to a safe &amp;rsquo;time-space point&amp;rsquo; in the darkness, letting those lurking &amp;rsquo;evil gods&amp;rsquo; temporarily lose sight of you. But once you&amp;rsquo;re in darkness for too long, you&amp;rsquo;ll be caught by the &amp;rsquo;evil gods.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remained silent for a while, then went on to ask, &amp;ldquo;How do you know all this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David suddenly tore off the cloth hanging on the shelf, revealing a wall full of scratch marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using one horizontal and three vertical lines as a unit of measurement, there were over a hundred marks, almost covering the majority of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each scratch represents one day. Measure it by a week,&amp;rdquo; David said morosely, &amp;ldquo;I have been trapped underground for two years. What I know is all the experience other survivors paid with their lives to figure out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to David, there might exist a four-dimensional space with energy-momentum inside the mantle… It could also be a five-dimensional or even higher-dimensional space, but with his cognitive ability, he was only able to understand a portion of the fourth dimension through the instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multi-dimensional space, there is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can observe the quantum changes in the micro world, thereby sensing the existence of humans. This is the original reason behind the bizarre photon changes - they are intentionally luring humans down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We dug into the mantle and overlapped with the fourth-dimensional space. It&amp;rsquo;s not a stable space, and it will continue to expand, just like the singularity of the universe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David drew a line on a piece of paper, explaining, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re the three-dimensional beings intruding into the four-dimensional space, like a worm crawling on top of a piece of paper, it won&amp;rsquo;t undergo any changes. But if you draw
a line in front of it, it will perceive it as an obstacle - in terms of time and space perception, higher-dimensional beings have an absolute advantage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David crumpled the paper and handed it to me, &amp;ldquo;In our perception, time is linear. This line represents the journey of a three-dimensional being, on a crumpled plane, the line will distort, overlap, and even merge. I can crumple it randomly, or I can deliberately overlap it, just like drawing a circle for the worm.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In other words, every time darkness falls, what I face is not only the space changes but also the changes in the timeline?&amp;rdquo; I quickly realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right, they manipulate our position in time and space as if drawing a line in front of a worm is effortless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked again: &amp;ldquo;What about these &amp;rsquo;evil gods&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;positive gods&amp;rsquo;? What exactly did you see in the mantle - in this fourth-dimensional space?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t ask, the less you know the better,&amp;rdquo; David held up three fingers: &amp;ldquo;There are three things we can never do in
here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;First, never pray to any god.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Second, never stay in the dark.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Third, never stare at any living creatures that are out of cognitive range.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most reliable source of light is fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As long as there&amp;rsquo;s sufficient oxygen and fuel, it will keep burning,&amp;rdquo; David handed me a kerosene lamp, &amp;ldquo;For safety reasons, we should each have one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ID card was still in my hand, even if the underground building was completely closed, we could take the elevator to any floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David suggested that I wrap myself in a white bedsheet, saying it was beneficial for concealment. I followed his advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the phantoms of ghost stories, we each held a kerosene lamp, groping our way in the dark, narrow corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They can sense our existence,&amp;rdquo; David said, &amp;ldquo;But because of the light, the evil gods can&amp;rsquo;t see us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It sounds safe,&amp;rdquo; I nodded, &amp;ldquo;As long as we maintain this status, we can find the elevator.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, this exactly means that the real horror is coming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If a sugar cube is mixed with grit, how would you get it out?&amp;rdquo; David paused, then continued, &amp;ldquo;Simple, just scatter a
bunch of ants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ants?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have you seen those bone spurs that were dug out of the mantle?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering those ghastly skeletons, I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re alive, they&amp;rsquo;re the ants that prey on us - there are many, many such creatures in here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David spread out a hand-drawn map, detailing every room and every passage in the lowest level, marking dangerous places with a red cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time we passed a corner or bypassed a branch road, David would explain to me in a low voice the reason for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Elevators with separate isolation rooms have been completely blocked, so our destination for this trip is the backup elevator, which is still operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are huge red tumors here, sticking to the ceiling, extending tentacles to prey on all creatures passing under it… This is where Xia Ning died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a stitched-up creature haunting this place, it sprays a kind of fungus that devours human brains, then attaches human limbs to its body… Old Li, Ah Cheng, and Zhang Mo, three people died here at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a human-faced spider on the left turn, its body is like liquid metal, it can stretch and squeeze at will, it almost has no hearing, it preys by spider web… Jennick sacrificed himself here to defend our retreat…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wang Zi was alive just last month… You should have seen him, the skinny one who always bragged about his daughter. He swallowed zinc hydride while I was asleep and committed suicide.&amp;rdquo;
David&amp;rsquo;s voice choked up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered Jennick was his brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When disaster struck, the survivors clung together for survival, struggling. Now, only David remained alive. There was no way forward, no way back; no sunlight up above, and it was hard to descend to the underworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a terrible loneliness and desperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just being alive took a lot of courage and determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think I hear someone calling my name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it a hallucination?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen carefully and frown, &amp;ldquo;No, it&amp;rsquo;s real. You didn&amp;rsquo;t hear it? It&amp;rsquo;s Shaun&amp;rsquo;s voice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shaun?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But hasn&amp;rsquo;t he been dead for a long time?&amp;rdquo; David wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as I was about to ask in detail, I saw David&amp;rsquo;s face suddenly change drastically. He raised his index finger to his mouth, signaling me to be quiet. Then he put his ear against the wall and listened carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four or five seconds later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Run!!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David suddenly shouted and started running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next moment, the entire passage began to vibrate, dust fell from the ceiling, and the walls made a sharp metallic
sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kerosene lamp swung with our movement, its light flickering. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s happening?!&amp;rdquo; I yelled as I ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &amp;lsquo;flood&amp;rsquo; is coming!&amp;rdquo; David called back, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t look back no matter what!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t look back?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon I heard the sound of water coming from behind, like some sticky liquid rushing through the pipes. Amidst numerous noises, I heard many people calling my name from behind. Some of the voices are young, some are old, and all of them are people I know, and even included my long-deceased mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s an elevator on the left! Hold on, don&amp;rsquo;t look back!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-intensity running made my chest rise and fall violently. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t experienced a 1500-meter run since college - lack of exercise made my lung capacity struggle to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between David and me widened, and a sense of despair washed over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the left turn, I saw David had run to the elevator door first, pressing the open button anxiously waiting. Since he couldn&amp;rsquo;t turn back, he had to shout at me back: &amp;ldquo;Run! This is the only way!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got into the elevator, David closed the metal door. I collapsed to my knees in front of the chair, gasping heavily, feeling as if my heart would jump out of my throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound of the door closing continued, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but turn around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- - In that instant, I understood why David warned me not to look back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dark corridor, countless black serpents with a single gigantic eye were coiling together, their pupils
refracting a crimson light. Just a glance froze me, making it difficult for me to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as if I had eaten a poisonous mushroom and was seeing distorted images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not until the elevator door closed and blocked my view did this strange state end. An intense vertigo made me feel
sick, and I was vomiting constantly on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boom-Boom-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elevator door was hit by a group of snakes, and the metal door was distorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This door won&amp;rsquo;t hold!&amp;rdquo; David said urgently. &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s the ID card? Hurry, start the elevator!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling with vertigo, I reached into my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having heard Shaun&amp;rsquo;s voice outside the door, I froze: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t give it to him! He&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;believer&amp;rsquo; too, he wants to escape from here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David yelled angrily: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to those ghost things! All I do is to save you and myself!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his gaze, I could feel the resolve and courage, but I became silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you hesitating about?!&amp;rdquo; David urged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said, &amp;ldquo;As long as you can answer one question, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you the ID card.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ask it quickly!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Although the design of the underground building was supposed to be a semi-permanent facility, that could last for more than fifty years. But last year we updated the oxygen system, the lowest level hasn&amp;rsquo;t caught up… so the oxygen here can only last a year and a half,&amp;rdquo; I looked at him and said in a low voice, &amp;ldquo;How did you survive for two years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the kerosene lamp in his hand went out without a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple, if David had experienced darkness within a year and a half, then he could have been transported to a year earlier - because the space-time here was chaotic, theoretically, he could survive for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the kerosene lamp in his hand extinguished, his body shriveled up, and became skeletal, and his face was frighteningly ferocious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David has been dead for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s a believer of the Positive God. As long as the kerosene lamp is lit, he can maintain his sanity and physical body,&amp;rdquo; Shaun&amp;rsquo;s voice from outside the door was hoarse, &amp;ldquo;Do you see it now? The Positive God and the Evil God are essentially the same.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like lightning piercing through the clouds, Shaun&amp;rsquo;s words made those minor details line up. I glimpsed part of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- - The high-dimensional intelligent entity broadens its dimension through observing and using light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming there are two kinds of intelligent entities in this dimension, the Positive God and the Evil God. The former can control the &amp;ldquo;three-dimensional space of the lighted area&amp;rdquo;, and the latter can &amp;ldquo;do whatever they want in the dark&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth was originally a place where day and night alternated, and the powers of the two should be balanced. But this place is underground, a place where the sun can&amp;rsquo;t reach. Therefore, the power of the Evil God expanded infinitely, overpowering the Positive God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both have an urgent common goal, which is to reach the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, they are willing to cooperate: The Positive God uses its ability to control light to maintain observation of photons, which makes the scientists in the Jinping Underground Laboratory discover anomalies and attract humans to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Evil God broadens the dimension, turns the bottom layer into a place without light, and starts to slaughter and contaminate humans. Just like the fungus that controls ants, it often controls the ant body to return to the ant nest, and then slowly breeds in the entire ant nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaun is an ant controlled by the Evil God, carrying some kind of &amp;ldquo;pathogen&amp;rdquo; that I can&amp;rsquo;t understand, and the second-to-last layer collapsed because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as humans pray, they can take them as believers. Becoming a believer will inevitably contaminate the spirit - this is also the reason why David warned me not to pray to the gods in his sane state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They maintain a competitive relationship in their cooperation, and obviously, neither of them has made it out so far.
Both the Positive God and the Evil God wanted to be the first to reach the surface, for which they were willing to trip each other up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the kerosene lamp in David&amp;rsquo;s hand went out, his body began to shrink, becoming skeletal and distorted, just like a monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this moment, David howled and rushed at me, but I kicked him away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stepped up to the elevator control panel and pressed the emergency stop button, and the elevator door slowly closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the kerosene lamp and went to the top of the elevator, opened the maintenance hole above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David tried to climb up, but in the next second, the metal door was knocked open, and countless crazed black snakes flooded into the elevator. I closed the maintenance hole and locked it from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I climbed out of the elevator shaft and arrived at the second-to-last floor, shaking off those monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kerosene lamp fuel was limited, I had three hours of safety period left. The time was not enough for me to climb up along the elevator shaft - just the one-kilometer distance between the bottom layer and the second-to-last layer almost exhausted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding some supplies and waiting for rescue was the safest option. But after what happened to David, I changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate the transportation of heavy objects like &amp;ldquo;Deep Diver&amp;rdquo;, a universal track has been set up in the spare elevator. Fortunately, the main maintenance is done on the second-to-last floor, allowing me to implement my plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I operate the control panel, change the slide track for the Deep Diver, and install it in the elevator shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After preparation, I put on the protective suit and continued to climb up along the elevator shaft, ready to enter the
Deep Diver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the sound of Sean echoes in the hollow elevator shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think the Deep Diver can break through the 33-story alloy blockade,&amp;rdquo; he stands in the emergency passage of the elevator shaft, his body is immersed in darkness, and I can only vaguely see a humanoid outline, &amp;ldquo;Relax, I also wish you can escape - I said this before you came down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remained silent for a while and replied, &amp;ldquo;Is it because I have also been mentally contaminated?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;…… Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;From the moment I saw that cross made of light, right?&amp;rdquo; I hesitated, sitting on the edge of the Deep Diver cabin,
&amp;ldquo;The moment you escaped, they radiated their power to the second to last floor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right, you were supposed to return to the surface with the favor of the true God. But you did not report back,
instead, you came down to investigate, disrupting our plans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a believer in the True God too?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, I am in darkness, a follower of the Evil God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean walked into where the kerosene lamp could shine, and leisurely said, &amp;ldquo;The explosives originally used to blast open the rock formations and the nuclear batteries in the experimental stage have all been concentrated here by you.
You simply want to gamble a little bit. The great kinetic energy and the narrow pipe effect will drive the Deep Diver to move at high speed upward and break through the blockade forcibly, just like a bullet being shot out of the gun barrel, and you can escape from the underground through this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I neither agreed nor disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no need to take risks, join us. Look at me now. I&amp;rsquo;m healthy. I have powers that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even imagine in
the past, and I can even live forever - &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the cost?&amp;rdquo; I interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is no cost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, there must be one. You&amp;rsquo;ve given up the dignity of being a human being, a group of humans, you&amp;rsquo;ve betrayed your country and your faith. We&amp;rsquo;ve spent thousands of years getting rid of feudalism and ignorance, and through the efforts of countless generations, we&amp;rsquo;ve built a beautiful country - I won&amp;rsquo;t allow anything to destroy it, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a deity, it has to submit to the glory of science and reason.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the use of saying all this?&amp;rdquo; Sean said mockingly, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re just a man afraid of death, as long as you escape, they&amp;rsquo;ll come to the surface, I don&amp;rsquo;t even need to stop you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled, picked up the kerosene lamp, and sat in the Deep Diver cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI started a countdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Detonation countdown has begun: 10, 9, 8, 7……&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; Wish me luck.&amp;rdquo; I fastened myself with the seat belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the porthole, I gave Sean the thumbs up. His face suddenly turned very bad, as if he realized what I was about to do. He started to scream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black snakes like a flood surged into the elevator and smacked at the Deep Diver, but it was already too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;……2, 1, 0……Detonation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countdown had ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fission of atoms unleashed terrifying light and heat that illuminated several underground buildings. The radiation and energy destroyed countless creatures hidden in the dark. The black snakes were burned to white bones. The Deep
Diver did not shoot upwards, instead like a bullet, it drilled into the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is my plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to go down to see the real faces of these &amp;ldquo;Gods&amp;rdquo;, and then invite them to eat a nuclear bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a second nuclear explosion in the mantle layer, the Deep Diver was also near its limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearly 10G acceleration caused me unbearable pain. The enormous potential energy pressed me hard against the backrest, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even breathe, it felt like my body was about to be torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes began to fill with blood and the world turned red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it took, but the Deep Diver&amp;rsquo;s speed slowed down to a level that I could bear. During this process, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any so-called gods, nor did I see any demons or evil spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the porthole, the red magma gradually turned into a hard rock formation. The Deep Diver automatically activated built-in kinetic energy and drilled straight ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instrument showed that the external temperature was decreasing, and I had a hunch in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the area beneath the mantle layer is a spherical high-dimensional space, according to relativity, it should not be a conventional sphere or singularity - which means that the interior of the high-dimensional space might be hollow, like the sandwich layer between two universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have thought that the universe is vast and infinite, constantly expanding outward. But actually, we might be inside the universe, and beneath the Earth is the outside of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-dimensional space is the &amp;ldquo;connecting point&amp;rdquo; that makes &amp;ldquo;two&amp;rdquo; universes curved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing through high-dimensional space, you can reach another planet similar to Earth, another crust layer, which can be verified from David&amp;rsquo;s drilling anomaly, he found that the heating no longer increased if you drill down, which
indicates that it might be another crust rather than the highly heated core below the mantle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What awaits me could be another parallel world or an unheard extraterrestrial civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deep Diver, having withstood two nuclear explosions and conducted nearly 20 kilometers of drilling, ended its
magnificent and tough life the moment it drilled out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kerosene lamp had long gone out, I left the cabin of the Deep Diver, but it was pitch black all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up drilling into the Earth&amp;rsquo;s core and being burned to ashes due to high temperatures, that proves
that my guess is not wrong. What awaits me now is the unknown. This is a new world that humans know nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first light of dawn pierced the darkness. I stood on the wreckage of the machinery in my protective suit, gazing into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night breeze was blowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; - I saw stars, the ocean, and a cross reaching heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*bCXxi7RBDZ6YvK0wN74oXA.png" alt="Featured image of post Has technology advanced too fast in the past century?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists would never imagine being drowned in the ocean of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Deity&amp;rsquo; suddenly appears, happily answering every question posed by mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the last question humans posed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked the &amp;lsquo;Deity&amp;rsquo;, &amp;ldquo;How can we become like you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Teacher!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quiet exam room, I suddenly raised my hand to call the invigilator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong? Is there a problem with the question?&amp;rdquo; The invigilator came to my side after hearing my request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s an answer sheet in my drawer.&amp;rdquo; I looked at her with the sincerest expression I could manage, a mix of obedience and grievance in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This…&amp;rdquo; The invigilator, seemingly encountering such a situation for the first time, looked urgently at the other invigilator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly, I became the focal point of the examination hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent disturbing the other students, an invigilator took me out of the examination hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is this answer sheet yours?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It isn&amp;rsquo;t mine. It inexplicably appeared in my drawer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the thing is not yours, how did it end up in your drawer? Didn&amp;rsquo;t we say before the exam to check the drawers?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I checked it! This thing just appeared out of thin air. If it was mine, why would I raise my hand and let you guys know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invigilator was at a loss for words for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, the head of the invigilation team passed by and saw me talking to the invigilator outside the examination hall, so he came over and asked, &amp;lsquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong? Is there anything this candidate needs?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Team Lead, you came at the right time. This student said he found an answer sheet in his drawer.&amp;rsquo; The invigilator handed the answer sheet to the team lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leader frowned, took a careful look at the answer, and his frown deepened, even becoming a bit flustered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where did you get this?&amp;rdquo; The leader asked me severely, pointing at the answer sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing him so furious, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t indulge him and stood upright, righteously denying, &amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not mine, it appeared out of nowhere, if you don&amp;rsquo;t believe it, you can check the surveillance.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Check it! We must check!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invigilator and I were frightened by the leader&amp;rsquo;s voice, which echoed throughout the entire teaching building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invigilator quickly pulled the group leader aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though they did their best to keep their voices down, I could still hear them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Team Lead, isn&amp;rsquo;t this going too far?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Going too far? Take a close look at this answer sheet. This is the correct answer to the exam!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t be? Is this considered a leak of the exam?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m telling you, we have to take this matter seriously. Today is the last day of the college entrance examination, we can&amp;rsquo;t allow any mishap. If we don&amp;rsquo;t handle it well, we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do this job anymore.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the two brought me to the surveillance room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the surveillance footage over and over again, the two finally believed my words. The answer did indeed appear in my drawer out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Team Lead, what should we do now?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;What should we do? I&amp;rsquo;ve been invigilating for over 20 years and I&amp;rsquo;ve never encountered such a situation.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Should we… call the police?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Call the police? Are you crazy?&amp;rsquo; The leader glared at the invigilator and then told me, &amp;lsquo;You go back to the exam first.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave the leader a blank look, he wasted my time, what else could I accomplish if I went back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to cause more trouble, so I followed the invigilator back to the exam room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had just sat down and was about to pick up my pen to write, and I noticed a piece of white paper poking out of my drawer. I pulled it out and it&amp;rsquo;s another answer sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I raised my hand again. The invigilator, who probably guessed what had happened, hurried over. Seeing another answer sheet appearing in my drawer, he almost fell over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at me, his eyes full of the expression &amp;lsquo;How come there&amp;rsquo;s another one?&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook my head, indicating that I knew nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invigilator crumpled up the answer sheet and gestured for me to continue the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded, about to continue writing, but once again I saw a paper filled with answers in my drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bell rang, the broadcast announced that candidates should put down their pens, and no new answer sheets appeared in my drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, the invigilator and I ended up retrieving over twenty answer sheets from my drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invigilator quickly organized the other candidates to leave the examination room, leaving only me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short while later, the group leader of the invigilation team arrived. He saw the exam room covered in paper and understood what had happened without needing any explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no other choice, he reported to the higher-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the team leader repeatedly explained and swore he hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone insane, the superiors were finally willing to deploy a team to the examination hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I and the invigilator tirelessly explained what had happened to these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They kept a skeptical attitude and thought it was just a case of exam leakage even when they held the correct answers to the exam in their hands. But, for the part where we said the answers appeared out of thin air, they thought we were insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Check the surveillance!&amp;rsquo; The team leader once again used his hysterical outburst to subdue everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, after watching the surveillance, everyone&amp;rsquo;s brows furrowed even more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;I suppose this is considered a supernatural phenomenon.&amp;rsquo; An older professor within the group with more authority said, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve lived so long, and this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a supernatural event with my own eyes.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Should we try and make the answer appear in the drawer again?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;We can try.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the group followed the professor back to the exam room and he sat at my exam desk under everyone&amp;rsquo;s watchful eyes.
But after waiting for over ten minutes, the drawer remained empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Could I try?&amp;rsquo; I said weakly amongst the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professor nodded and gave his seat up to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the drawer was still empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps it only works during a test,&amp;rdquo; I guessed. &amp;ldquo;Could a teacher give me a test paper? A simulation paper will do.&amp;rdquo;
Another invigilator ran back to his office and randomly picked a simulation paper, then returned and put it on my desk.
&amp;lsquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s complete the process and treat it like a formal examination. Everyone else should go to the surveillance room and watch.&amp;rsquo; The professor called everyone besides the invigilator out of the exam room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, only the invigilator and I remained in the exam room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Cough cough… now I will read the exam rules…&amp;rsquo; The invigilator began the simulation examination like a formal test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got into condition, carefully looking at the questions on the test and trying my best to ignore whether there were answers in the drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished the first question when the door to the exam room was pushed open, and the professor quickly entered.
Seeing his anxious state, I quickly checked the drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, there was a paper filled with answers in my drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professor held the paper in his hands like a treasure and then compared it with my test paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Absolutely correct.&amp;rsquo; The professor&amp;rsquo;s voice shook a little in excitement. For a moment, I was afraid he would faint from the excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following that, the school was entirely locked down and publicly announced as being for renovation planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more distinguished individuals like the professor came to the school, a few of whom I even saw on television, famous scientists included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several comparative experiments over a few days, scientists eventually summed up the phenomena of the appearing answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must be the examinee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the exam, there must be, and no more than, three invigilators present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam paper must list the questions in a specific format, and each question must have a score with a total not exceeding 150 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam process must follow the standard procedure of the college entrance examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the exam, the answers will no longer appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having ascertained the pattern and conditions under which the answers appeared, the scientists began to let their imaginations run wild. And I began to ponder with the papers in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please elaborate on the formation process of the universe. (10 points)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please list 10 planets with alien civilizations that are closest to the Earth. (1 point each, total 10 points)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please elaborate on the evolution process of humans and your predictions for human development in the future. (10 points)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;……&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these questions, I even doubted if the answers would appear in my drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, after waiting for about ten or so minutes, my drawer began to overflow like a breached dam, spewing out countless sheets of paper filled with words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invigilators and I quickly started collecting them, we collected as if we were gathering water, stacking each completed pile to the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process continued for more than twenty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finally placed the last stack of answers down, both the invigilators and I were exhausted, lying among the piles of paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The exam…..the exam is over, please…..please stop answering the questions.&amp;rdquo; The invigilator, breathless, stated.
I truly admire his professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the scientists, as if they had found a treasure, rushed in, carefully picking up the piles of paper from the floor as if they were cradling a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t care; I just hoped that after all this, I would have a chance to retake the test. After all, with my strength of being in the top ten of the school, I didn&amp;rsquo;t need those answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the scientists had their fill, the only ones left in the exam hall were the invigilator and I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Teacher, aren&amp;rsquo;t you curious how these papers came to be?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If the smartest of us don&amp;rsquo;t want to know, why would I be interested? All I know is that after all this, we small figures will have a chance to stand out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a moment of silence, I said, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, I want to know who sent these papers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright, since no one is around to check on us, tell me what you want to ask, and I&amp;rsquo;ll help you set the questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I followed the invigilator to the office, where we sat by a computer and started creating a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll use the template for a language arts paper.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;For the question…let&amp;rsquo;s write it this way: &amp;lsquo;Please write a composition introducing yourself, there is no word limit, but no poems are allowed.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just like that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just like that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the exam hall, the invigilator read the exam rules aloud, a recitation he had done dozens of times today and would likely never forget in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The exam begins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the invigilator declared the start of the exam, I began eagerly waiting for the answer in my drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after, a piece of paper appeared in my drawer. Unlike the previous answers which were all printed, this one had been written by hand, each character beautifully penned within its square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With excitement, I took it out, and the invigilator also came to me excitedly, our shared enthusiasm wasn&amp;rsquo;t less than what the scientists had felt just moments ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearing my throat, I began to read the text on the paper aloud:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a name or a physical form as you humans understand it, I can be self-contained or superimposed, I won&amp;rsquo;t die though I&amp;rsquo;m not technically living. I believe you have a term that describes me perfectly, and that is - teacher. From here on, to facilitate your understanding, I will introduce myself and my purpose based on your human cognition. I was born before the formation of the universe, wandering in all its corners, using my unlimited time to question my existence. Finally, during my wanderings, I discovered something interesting, that is - life. There is countless life in outer space as you humans fantasize, and they all take different forms. After I discovered life, I shifted from aimless wandering to curious observation. During my unlimited time, I even felt lonely for the first time due to a specific event, specifically, the demise of life. Every life that sprung forth on every planet will eventually succumb to death, some because of war, some because of disaster, and some because of diseases… This kind of end is disappointing. I knew that in this finite universe, life would expire at a specific moment, I kept wondering why life would die, until one day, I finally understood. Life cannot forsake the desire for knowledge since its birth. Facing curiosity at birth, life will strive to pursue, only knowledge is the key to continuing life&amp;rsquo;s development, but without someone to guide, life will inevitably hit a dead end within its limited span. Therefore, I decided to satisfy life&amp;rsquo;s curiosity unconditionally, using my unlimited time and knowledge to fulfill all of life&amp;rsquo;s developmental needs. In your words, I want to do all this as simply as breathing, although I don&amp;rsquo;t need to breathe. This desk&amp;rsquo;s drawer is your communication channel with me, I will answer everything you want to know. You only need to do one thing, let life continue, without the shackles of knowledge, your only purpose for existence is to live, while my purpose for existence is to allow you to live. As for you, child, you are the intermediary between humans and me. I have found an intermediary in every group of life forms. The selection criteria are not difficult, you only need to report to your counterparts that there is an answer in their drawer, that is all. Yet even so, only a small percentage of life forms can do this, but I don&amp;rsquo;t blame you, after all, the desire for personal gain will also cease to exist in due course during the process of knowledge exploration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It sounds like a god.&amp;rdquo; The invigilator shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;According to what&amp;rsquo;s written here, the purpose of our future existence is to live?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pretty much, the rest of them are that, while you kind of mixed in with being the human class president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Will those scientists have as many questions as it says in the answer here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invigilator looked out the window, seeing those scientists still laughing and crying madly for those stacks of answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, once the world has the answers, more questions will emerge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do I need to show this &amp;lsquo;Self Introduction&amp;rsquo; essay to the scientists?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go ahead, they will like it and will be even crazier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the &amp;ldquo;Teacher&amp;rdquo; transformed humans from a proud ant in the universe to a humble student among countless civilizations in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the invigilator had said, scientists received all the answers they could ever want, but these answers themselves only served as the genesis of the next question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like knowing that 1+1=2, we then start to wonder why 1+1 can only be 2, or why 1 needs to be added to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is endless. We once thought that seeking the answer to a question required countless day and night efforts, and now it merely takes one exam and one examiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That desk spews out papers filled with answers almost every day, and I take exams almost every day or rather, I help our human &amp;ldquo;Teacher&amp;rdquo; disseminate knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite seeing myself working on this task for the rest of my life, the only things I need to do are to sit at my seat, collect and tidy up the answers, and then pass them to the scientists outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I act as an essential &amp;ldquo;intermediary&amp;rdquo; between human civilization and the &amp;ldquo;Teacher&amp;rdquo;, answering all requests, my work is relatively monotonous except for occasional excitement due to heavyweight issues resulting in a room full of papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only consolation is that I can feel the leap forward that humans have taken based on the &amp;ldquo;Teacher&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; answers, the strong sense of societal need makes me kind of proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, compared to this minor pride, I yearned more for freedom- the scientists&amp;rsquo; obsession left me little to no chance to leave the exam hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, as an &amp;ldquo;intermediary&amp;rdquo;, after bargaining with the scientists and the person in charge, I was granted a leave of four days every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might sound like not much, but it&amp;rsquo;s like working six days and getting one day off, so I divided these four days evenly over the four weeks of every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first-weekend leave was approaching, I was notably excited, and the pace at which I was collecting the answers from my desk&amp;rsquo;s drawer also increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists also understood that I was taking a day off tomorrow, hence they seemed a bit blue which led to an increase in the number of questions by several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If they could swim in the sea of knowledge someday, they might not even want to wear swimming trunks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking this, I finally made it to my first day off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping outside of the exam hall, I took a look back at the school that had been commandeered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All buildings had been renovated, and the most conspicuous was a huge golden sign standing at the highest point, reading &amp;ldquo;The Examination of Human Civilization&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seemed like humans had made a golden placard for themselves, still flaunting their once pride and self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although human knowledge had grown by leaps and bounds, there was still a diversity of aesthetics. I never dared to look at that golden sign for the second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I returned to the bustling city, where everything seemed to be the same as the day I went for the college entrance examination - there were still four-wheeled vehicles on the road, and people with two legs on the sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got home to find that my parents had prepared dinner in advance knowing that I was going to take a vacation. They might have spent a long time accepting and understanding my job as a &amp;ldquo;middleman&amp;rdquo;. However, all they needed to know was that I was far better than other youngsters on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not only my parents knew about my vacation. When the news spread, relatives and neighbors flocked to my house, with those bringing gifts, those trying to curry favor, and those looking for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents blocked wave after wave of people for me, but they never seemed to be bothered. Instead, they looked happier with every passing moment because my situation was something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thought it would be an easy day, but the scientists of the examination hall beckoned me back before I could finish my mother&amp;rsquo;s handmade steak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to their re-emerging new problem, my steak desire seemed somewhat overwhelmed. They were so impassioned that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait for a second longer. All they wanted was for me to return to the examination hall and continue my &amp;ldquo;middleman&amp;rdquo; duties immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was somewhat helpless and wanted to share something with my parents, but seeing their expectant faces made me hold back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is the second vacation of this month. I&amp;rsquo;m prepared to be &amp;ldquo;bombarded&amp;rdquo; continuously by the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the scientists smiled as they placed a whole stack of test papers in front of me. I nodded and smiled as I accepted their quest for knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I even wondered if the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; would ever feel as outwardly cordial but inwardly upset as I did.
Until the scientists left, I noticed, that this so-called &amp;lsquo;scientist&amp;rsquo; was just a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me curious about the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of my second vacation, I left the examination hall and noticed out of the corner of my eye that the panel that originally read &amp;ldquo;Examination of Human Civilization&amp;rdquo; was no longer a golden plaque but a holographic projection changing color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vehicles on the street no longer sped along the road on four wheels but hovered above the road, flashing neon. The pedestrians were all wearing matching light-colored clothes, and unlike the fast-paced life I saw them live last week, they all seemed to be enjoying themselves now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor was replaced by intelligence, and the acquisition, processing, and distribution of resources were fully automated. Work became a thing of the past. With all the obstacles to survival removed, all that was left was to enjoy.
Endless knowledge-seeking led to a technological breakthrough last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population, disease, environment, and so on, these problems were all solved in an instant of technological explosion.
This is the power of knowledge. Under the guidance of the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; answers, some fallacies have now become truths, and some past truths are now regarded as jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got home, I saw my parents lying in bed with virtual reality devices on their heads, and a robot beside them was cooking celery stir-fried beef for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what my parents are seeing in the virtual device, but given how things are going now, even the outrageous scenarios in virtual reality might be realized in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating the robot-made celery stir-fried beef, I felt that the supremely fresh celery and tender and juicy beef were not as good as my father&amp;rsquo;s half-cooked celery and slightly burnt beef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vacation hadn&amp;rsquo;t ended yet, and I had already returned to the examination hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the un-clean blackboards in the examination hall, the wallpaper that was about to fall off the wall, smelling the musty smell coming from the desks and chairs, I only then realized that the world outside of the examination hall seemed to be devoid of any smell, which made me feel like there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any air outside, like I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been breathing, like I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the third day of vacation this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day before the vacation, the scientists did not give me a lot of test papers as usual, even a lot less than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t wonder why. I just placed the answers according to the routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finished, the scientists walked into the examination hall. This time they didn&amp;rsquo;t embrace a pile of answers like mad as they did before. Instead, they took me out of the examination hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until we arrived at a huge open space aboard a strangely shaped spaceship that I noticed that a crowd had gathered near the open space, cheering excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what people were celebrating, nor did I know why the surrounding scientists were constantly adjusting their bow ties, even my long-neglected hair was combed by someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We seem to be meeting someone,&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, a few minutes later, ten aircraft appeared overhead, and as the crowd got even more rapturous, the scientists also stood up straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ten aircraft landed, slowly the cabin doors began to open, and a long ramp extended from the bottom of the doors down to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There at the cabin doors of the ships, countless creatures of different shapes and forms were seen coming down from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten ships, ten types of creatures, or more accurately, they should be called - aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally understood why today was such a grand occasion. This was the first time in human history face-to-face with alien races. These ten alien races were all the ten planets in the original question &amp;ldquo;Please list 10 planets with alien civilizations that are closest to Earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing aliens for the first time made me a little nervous, but when I put on the simultaneous translation earphones, I found that these aliens were not much different from us, just a bit strange-looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through conversation, all the scientists who visited Earth this time were scientists and &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rdquo; from their respective alien races, and they had come all this way to discuss cooperation with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including human scientists, the alien scientists all agree that the knowledge of a single civilization is too unilateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the ten alien races plus humans, a total of eleven races, eleven &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rdquo;, will have eleven communication channels with the &amp;ldquo;teacher&amp;rdquo; and eleven completely different perspectives of knowledge seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a new, all-inclusive, new cosmic civilization will be born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-operation went smoothly, but it was more of a coincidence between cross-territorial races than negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, we eleven &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rdquo; also had a simple exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the mouths of the alien &amp;ldquo;middlemen,&amp;rdquo; I learned about their experience of becoming a &amp;ldquo;middleman&amp;rdquo; and how they asked questions to the &amp;ldquo;teacher.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rdquo; come from different planets and have different lives, in our conversation we occasionally miss our race&amp;rsquo;s dues past - perhaps this is a resonance of being a &amp;ldquo;middleman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &amp;ldquo;middleman&amp;rdquo; point of view, the &amp;ldquo;teacher&amp;rdquo; has brought us endless knowledge, but also deprived us of the process of exploring knowledge. The desire for knowledge cannot be changed, because it is instinct, but the path to knowledge is optional. Maybe to look at the scenery along the way to civilization before hitting a dead end of development, might be more meaningful than just surviving smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is all just our &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; own ideas. Compared to the weight of an entire civilization, our ideas seem frivolous and wishful thinking, after all in reality, who will have a bag that forever produces gold coins and not use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meeting with the aliens was nearing its end, and one of the human scientists suddenly posed a question - the issue of freedom of the &amp;ldquo;middlemen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the words were spoken, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but sigh, our people are indeed more humane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The existence of the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; has brought about unprecedented knowledge freedom for each civilization. Each individual of these civilizations is enjoying this freedom, except for the &amp;lsquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; said the human scientist to everyone. &amp;ldquo;It is great to trade one person&amp;rsquo;s freedom for the freedom of an entire civilization, but it is also brutal. Can we, with all our unlimited knowledge, let the &amp;lsquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo; enjoy the meaning of life like the rest of us?&amp;rdquo;
Listening to the appeal of my fellow scientists, I was nearly moved to tears, but when I looked around, the gathering of scientists was looking at each other in apprehension and hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At present, we can only do our best to fulfill all the &amp;lsquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; requirements to make up for their hard work, after all, we have tried the method of removing the &amp;lsquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo; and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.&amp;rdquo; said an alien scientist who looked like a squid while dripping slime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps many of you here have not understood the deep meaning of my question, let me put it straightforwardly, is there a possibility that one day we will no longer need the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; and become a &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; ourselves?&amp;rdquo; said the human scientist seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The presence of the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; transcends all things in the universe, if we want to become like the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo;… this is a little unrealistic.&amp;rdquo; says a &amp;lsquo;middleman&amp;rsquo; made entirely of stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yet we all know that knowledge is infinite, it&amp;rsquo;s just a little bit of trouble. I believe there must be some way to make it, maybe we can ask the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; how to become an entity like it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This issue might be more complex than asking the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; about how the universe came to be,&amp;rdquo; I interjected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists and &amp;lsquo;mediators&amp;rsquo; present initially were stunned by my comment but then burst into laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not that complicated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you saying you don&amp;rsquo;t know how the universe came to be?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s basic knowledge, you should revisit it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;… …&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this bustling hall, it seemed that I was the only one ignorant about the formation of the universe, ah… Yes, I was the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These uproarious people finally quieted down and started discussing the question of how one becomes a &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;, once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in this hall filled with wisdom, the scientists made the following arrangements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Question Raising Plan]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human civilization will raise the question, &amp;ldquo;How to become an existence like the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing lessons from the results of previous substantial questions, the scientists decided to hollow out Mars to serve as the &amp;rsquo;examination hall&amp;rsquo;, to store the upcoming flurry of answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week of preparation time will be given during which the technology of all eleven civilizations will be gathered, all for the sake of this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the plans written in my hands, I swallowed my saliva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollowing out Mars in a week… recalling the transformations in human technology in the past week, I decided to believe in this plan that seemed like a joke to me. The only regret was that I would miss my fourth vacation day next week.
After the [Question Raising Plan] was released, the civilizations of the eleven races also began to accelerate the advancement of their technological levels through question raising, to speed up the plan of hollowing out Mars. It can be said that the technological levels of all civilizations are increasing at an unprecedented speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I, for one, didn&amp;rsquo;t care about all of this, I was only concerned about one thing, whether raising this issue would bring about some irreversible consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &amp;lsquo;mediator&amp;rsquo; who doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know how the universe was formed, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what those consequences could be. If there were any, then they were purely intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week passed quickly, and the [Question Raising Plan] began to be implemented as per plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the examination hall and followed the scientists to the launch pad. There, a spaceship that looked strikingly like a crescent moon rested on the ground, and standing by its side was my old acquaintance - the original examination invigilator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mentor, why are you here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They said there needed to be a sense of ritual. Since I was the one who invigilated the first examination, I should be the one to invigilate this one as well. There should be continuity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged at that. Despite holding an abundant amount of knowledge and technology, humans still couldn&amp;rsquo;t let go of their sense of romanticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I boarded the ship with the invigilator. Of course, the examination desk joined us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the instructions given by the scientists, I pushed the start button. All that was needed now was for the smart system to help us choose the flight route. Everything was so simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the spaceship took off, I looked out of the window and saw masses of people outside the examination hall building. They were cheering and dancing, appearing like waves from mid-air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the sign saying &amp;lsquo;Human Civilization&amp;rsquo;s Examination Hall&amp;rsquo; has now been transformed into a panel composed of some kind of floating particles, making the words on the panel seem fluid like water flow. The technology to create this was far beyond my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship moved rapidly, and in the blink of an eye, we were outside the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mentor, like you said, with every answer comes more questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As long as infinite knowledge exists, it is inevitable that infinite questions will arise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, I meant that humans themselves have become the problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Humans themselves?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know that human development is fast now, almost condensing a thousand years of slow progress into weeks, but to me, it feels like this isn&amp;rsquo;t really living, or perhaps humans have already died.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What died is your previous perception of humans,&amp;rdquo; the invigilating mentor seemed to understand my thoughts: &amp;ldquo;Humans are still alive, living by the meaning &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; gave them, and even though not as you said, dead, humans are now almost like the walking dead, laden with the fast technology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it clear?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let me give you an example, the first half of human life is like a child, curious about everything, putting everything in their mouth, crying when choked, laughing when they taste the sweetness, acquiring knowledge is not easy yet gaining emotions is easier, so life&amp;rsquo;s first feelings overcame the rationality of knowledge, humans then lived relying on feelings, until the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; appeared. Infinity knowledge brings infinite rationality, and even it&amp;rsquo;s easier than gaining emotions. Therefore, rationality wins over sentimentality. When there is reason and evidence instead of affection and love, the only thing left is to try to live somehow. But humans, any alien species, bear a limited obsession, we are unable to understand the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;s infinity due to our innate limitation, so we cannot become completely rational beings yet discard most of our sentimentality, in the end, we become the walking dead carrying the technology express without a final station.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So… was the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; wrong?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but do you remember that self-introductory article?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I remember.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It mentions how the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;, like us, was also searching for its existence. Until it discovered life, and it decided its purpose was to make life live, maybe even the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; itself does not know whether this is right. Similarly, when the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; was uncertain about its existence, it gave us living beings a purpose of existence, isn&amp;rsquo;t this itself a selfish desire? To us living beings, this selfish desire of the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; has become the truth, because we are too insignificant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Will this question be the last question?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps the hardworking &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; will still be happy to answer, even find it admirable, perhaps there is a way to turn these insignificant lives into something like the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s just…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just, I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether humans, as &amp;lsquo;students&amp;rsquo;, can bear the weight of this knowledge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing the Mentor&amp;rsquo;s words, I fell silent, looking at the countless stars in the surrounding universe, I felt they had lost their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, the ship arrived on the periphery of Mars. If it were me in the past, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to resist the excitement and would be glued to the window enjoying the view of the alien planet. But now, my mood was a bit heavy and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart to look at the red landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft didn&amp;rsquo;t land on the surface of Mars, but after adjusting its speed and direction, it headed towards a borehole on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the spacecraft entered the borehole. Under high speed, I could see that the surroundings of the borehole were incredibly smooth, and even the marking lines were straight. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what technology was used, but given the current technological progress of the eleven races, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to speculate anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft accelerated all the way, eventually reaching a part of the planet illuminated by white light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white light was made up of countless light sources on the inner wall of the planet. Due to the vastness of the planet&amp;rsquo;s interior, I had a feeling as if a light had been switched on in a dark universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few seconds later, the spacecraft stopped flying and landed on a floating platform in the center of the planet&amp;rsquo;s interior. This was the exam site inside Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system told us in a sweet voice that we could disembark. I slowly opened the cabin door, took a deep breath, and stepped out of the spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the gravitational pull of the floating platform kept me securely on its surface, there was still a slight feeling of weightlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I squatted down to adapt for a few minutes, then took the desk and chair out of the spacecraft and placed it. The invigilator took the test paper with only one question and stood in front of the blackboard that was already prepared.
&amp;ldquo;The exam time is 150 minutes…&amp;rdquo; The invigilator began to read out the exam rules, and I sat upright in my seat.
After reading the rules, the invigilator put the test paper on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How to become an existence like the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;? (150 points)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, people asked this ultimate question as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the test paper and was slightly stunned. Maybe to commemorate my long role as the &amp;lsquo;Middleman,&amp;rsquo; or maybe to make up for the many times I didn&amp;rsquo;t write in previous exams, I picked up the pen and regarded this question as a question for me, and quietly wrote down my answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how the universe was formed, because I know it has nothing to do with me. Ever since I became the &amp;lsquo;Middleman,&amp;rsquo; the papers handed to me have nothing to do with me anymore. Even if I&amp;rsquo;m a student, I know these questions don&amp;rsquo;t belong to me. On the day when humans were given a purpose by the &amp;lsquo;Teacher,&amp;rsquo; I was also given the meaning of a &amp;lsquo;Middleman&amp;rsquo;, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what I wanted. I know that this way of thinking is just because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been blessed with knowledge. Just like an old man who thinks that a camera will steal people&amp;rsquo;s souls, I see the rational knowledge brought by the &amp;lsquo;Teacher&amp;rsquo; as a curse. I don&amp;rsquo;t want the purpose of existence to be just to live. I want the meaning of existence to have its meaning every moment, just like I miss the days when I still had to boil water to generate electricity. This is probably because I want to retain most of my emotions and eat that undercooked celery and beef with a hint of burnt taste.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invigilating teacher looked at my answer and smiled: &amp;ldquo;You wrote well, but you went off-topic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I raised my head and laughed back at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, like an explosion, a large amount of answer paper filled the entire interior of Mars from the drawer of the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second later, the answer paper filled the entire interior of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five seconds later, the answer paper caused the outer shell of Mars to burst, with the paper spewing out like a volcanic eruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten seconds later, the answer paper spread to every corner of the solar system, centered on Mars. People on Earth remained calm, expecting the paper to stop spewing out at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen seconds later, the answer paper swallowed up all the planets in the solar system, including Earth, like weightless seawater. Even the sun didn&amp;rsquo;t burn the answer paper as fast as it produced it, not to mention that the speed of the answer paper&amp;rsquo;s production was still accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One minute later, the answer paper filled the entire galaxy, and the black hole in the center of the galaxy continued to absorb and engulf these papers, its event horizon also constantly expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five minutes later, the event horizon of the black hole in the center of the galaxy expanded to the nearby galaxies and devoured them, and the production of the answer paper reached an unimaginable speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later, the largest black hole in the universe was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen minutes later, the black hole devoured everything in the universe and reached its limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty minutes later, the black hole spewed out matter at an incredibly fast rate, and a few minutes later, the basic particles began to form…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After answering, the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; finally recovered. But the universe seemed to have changed, the once dazzling starlight disappeared, and all that was left was empty darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; felt a sense of loneliness. It wandered in the darkness, not knowing how long it passed, everything around it started to become clear, and small and large matter started to congregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After who knows how long, the universe regained its calm, and those colorful starlights filled the universe&amp;rsquo;s space once again, which made the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; feel a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at this moment, the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; suddenly felt a fluctuation in this tranquil universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking towards the fluctuation, it once again discovered the existence of life, which was surprisingly similar to the original humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; was so excited that it wanted to quietly put the answers in the humans&amp;rsquo; drawers again when a calling sound that only the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; could hear echoed from the outside of the universe, it was its kin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosion of the universe&amp;rsquo;s black hole once again drew their attention and found the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; that had strayed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; will no longer be lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that life was similar to humans, perhaps in the future they might fall into a development dead end, but they will also have the right to appreciate the scenery along the way and more meanings of existence, more meanings that will never stay the same every moment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This world is not true…</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/p/this-world-is-not-true/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 01:51:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/p/this-world-is-not-true/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*QBZD4BUKuJntCWq51iV9jQ.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post This world is not true…" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A million years ago, humans had just learned to make fire, ending the days of eating raw meat and drinking blood. At dusk, a group of ape men returned to the cave with their prey and started a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this moment, another person walked in from outside the cave, his face hidden in the darkness, unclear to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart ape-man raised a torch, and tentatively approached the newcomer, scrutinizing him all over. Yes, he looked the same as himself, apparently of the same kind, but this smart ape-man always felt that something was not quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked the man in low murmurs, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen you before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man laughed, &amp;ldquo;Just a passer-by, wanting to sleep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are social animals, so the people in the cave agreed to his request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At deep night, when everyone else had fallen asleep, the man who held the torch earlier couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep at all. He kept thinking of one question over and over again -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What exactly was wrong with this person who came in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nose, two eyes, a mouth, two ears, two arms, two legs…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything seemed normal, and nothing extra like any tail or wings stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clever ape-man couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve this mystery at the moment, but he felt that something was off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He silently glanced at the man who had come to stay overnight, who was sound asleep at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in the night, he also fell asleep and had a dream where he saw the man who had lodged there again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dream, only the two of them were there, and he felt a bit scared, calling upon the gods as a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That man seemed to see through his thoughts and said, &amp;ldquo;Shh, even the heavens do not know of my existence…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two got closer and closer, and as he shook all over, watching the other, he finally remembered what seemed off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he woke up, he ran out of the cave like a madman, howling fiercely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s too terrifying! I need to tell everyone this secret!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that moment on, mankind&amp;rsquo;s gene for fear of &amp;rsquo;that&amp;rsquo; has been passed down. Thus, the term &amp;lsquo;Uncanny Valley&amp;rsquo; has also been derived in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my home office, at this moment, my cousin Lin Yu types the last word on her computer and looks up at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So what happened next? What kind of secret did the clever ape-man end up discovering?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked, curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin shut her computer, picked up the coffee next to her, and ambiguously said as she sipped it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a story I just wrote, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure what the secret is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing her answer, my face fell, &amp;ldquo;Huh, I was just so entranced watching you write. I was waiting for you to figure out the answer. You&amp;rsquo;re the author, and you don&amp;rsquo;t even know!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin looked at me, &amp;ldquo;Lin Yan, don&amp;rsquo;t you usually have a lot of ideas? Why don&amp;rsquo;t you help me figure out how to develop this secret.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was speechless, &amp;ldquo;What the heck? You&amp;rsquo;re a horror story writer, and you came to me for answers?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin patted me on the shoulder, &amp;ldquo;This is called brainstorming. My initial plan was to make the passing ape-man a monster, but that seemed too cliche and lacked suspense.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Since your story is themed around the uncanny valley, you certainly can&amp;rsquo;t describe it as a monster …&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, I stood up and took a book from the shelf - a foreign book mainly about the works of various world-renowned horror authors, along with some theoretical analysis of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a particular page, I handed the book to my cousin. I sat back down and said, &amp;ldquo;You see, the earliest theory about the uncanny valley pertains to robots and non-human objects.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin grimaced, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve known about this basic theory for long.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She claimed so, but she still patiently studied the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but laugh: &amp;ldquo;So since your story starts with an ancient ape-man, robots are clearly out of the question. It&amp;rsquo;s illogical, would break immersion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for a particular page, I handed the book to my cousin and sat back down. &amp;ldquo;See, the earliest theory of the uncanny valley pertains to robots and non-human entities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin pouted, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of this basic theory for a long time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though she said that she was still patiently studying the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but laugh, &amp;ldquo;So, since your story starts with an ancient ape-man, a robot is immediately out of the question. It&amp;rsquo;s illogical, and the anachronism breaks immersion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without lifting her head, my cousin said, &amp;ldquo;Exactly. So, I initially defined this thing as something that looks the same as humans but has one fatal flaw, and this flaw, once discovered by humans, will out it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piqued my interest. &amp;ldquo;That sounds good. So what is the flaw?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoyed, my cousin said, &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t I just say? I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought it through yet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing that my cousin was still deep in thought, I flippantly suggested, &amp;ldquo;Mars people? Lizard people? People from the underground?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go away!&amp;rdquo; My cousin waved me off dismissively. &amp;ldquo;Such a boring setting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, my cousin pointed to her computer. &amp;ldquo;But I&amp;rsquo;ve already chosen a name for it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What name?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are human, so they are… human-like!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing this name, I leaned back on the couch. &amp;ldquo;Why are you so casual? Besides, if a reader doesn&amp;rsquo;t hear well, they might think it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;startling&amp;rsquo;, making it even more startling.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a gesture of disdain, my cousin continued to read her book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I remembered a snippet from the novel earlier and asked curiously, &amp;ldquo;Cousin, why does the clever ape-man feel something is off when he first sees the human-like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gave me a deep look and asked puzzlingly, &amp;ldquo;Lin Yan, do you feel scared looking at me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Huh?&amp;rdquo; The question confused me. &amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing my reaction, my cousin&amp;rsquo;s tense face relaxed into a playful smile. She said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One characteristic of the human-like is that even before their flaw is discovered, a small portion of humans can detect them and will feel fear towards the human-like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But fear must have a source. If the human-like flaw hasn&amp;rsquo;t been discovered, how can humans feel afraid?&amp;rdquo; My curiosity grew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin put the book on the table and suddenly stopped talking. Staring blankly at me with an expressionless face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Big sis, why are you staring at me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a bit uncomfortable with her demeanor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tilted her head slightly with an ambiguous smile and asked,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why do you assume that the person who came to your house today is your real cousin?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a buzz, I instantly felt my scalp tighten!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You… are joking around again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried not to appear too embarrassed on the face. I assumed she&amp;rsquo;d be amused again, as she was when she saw my shocked reaction earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few seconds later, something felt wrong. My cousin was still staring at me with that indifferent and eerie gaze!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was completely out of sync with her usual persona!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say anything. My body wound tight, all I wanted to do was to escape this room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin at that moment looked as if she was possessed by an unknown entity, or like a mentally disturbed person - as if her acquired persona of over twenty years was merely a charade, and only now was her true self revealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly, she got up and moved her face closer to mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jumped at the situation, my body tensing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her face got closer to mine, and then, she burst out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Silly little brother, you got scared by me again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned around and sat back down in her chair, her demeanor returning to the familiar one, with a cunning smile of success on her lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a sigh of relief, I threw a hand cushion at her and shouted,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lin Yu! Are you crazy?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hahahaha!&amp;rdquo; Seeing my reaction, my cousin became even more amused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just wait, one day I&amp;rsquo;ll frighten you too!&amp;rdquo; I said helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin put her laptop into her backpack and said, &amp;ldquo;I was doing a little experiment earlier, and also answering your question.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What question?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Weren&amp;rsquo;t you asking me why humans inexplicably feel afraid of the human-like? I think our recent experiment could partly explain that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on her demeanor just a minute ago, I had an epiphany, &amp;ldquo;I get it. You&amp;rsquo;re saying, when a familiar person suddenly becomes strange and eerie, that&amp;rsquo;s also a form of the uncanny valley, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exactly!&amp;rdquo; My cousin snapped her fingers, &amp;ldquo;Assume I&amp;rsquo;m a human-like. You didn&amp;rsquo;t notice my flaw, but you were still scared. This was because my abnormality created an enigma, causing you to fear.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded involuntarily. Her words did make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, have you figured out how to write the story about the ape-man and the human-like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin sighed and put on her backpack, &amp;ldquo;Not yet. I need to think more about what the flaw of the human-like could be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright, I hope you can think of a fascinating flaw. Let me know as soon as you do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&amp;rdquo; My cousin waved her hand dismissively and left the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon opening the lock, she had just taken a step when she suddenly paused and asked me a question in a low voice,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lin Yan, do you remember a sentence from the story I was writing earlier?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Which sentence?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without turning her head, she said, &amp;ldquo;The human-like stated that even God was unaware of its existence. So, where do you think it came from?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bam! She closed the door tightly behind her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, despite it being noon, I felt a chill run through my body. Her last sentence, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t comprehend…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days later, this event was still looming in my mind. I even started resisting sleep every night, afraid of dreaming about the troop of apes and … that human-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened up my phone and saw that my cousin Lin Yu&amp;rsquo;s writing blog had been updated with a story about the human-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps she has figured out the human-like&amp;rsquo;s flaw!&amp;rdquo; Excited, I clicked in and started browsing. After all, I was really curious about this secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is her updated document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When another tribe found the clever ape-man, he had gone insane. He was completely covered in mud and had a lot of wounds. It seemed like he had suffered a lot on his journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ape-men from that time didn&amp;rsquo;t know the concept of going mad. Seeing his state, they thought he was possessed by an evil spirit. So, they tied him up and surrounded him in the middle of the crowd, praying again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s already here! It&amp;rsquo;s blended in among us!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clever ape-man couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop roaring, repeatedly shouting these words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This added to the fear, making people dare not approach him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you the secret about it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing this, the leader of the tribe stood up and slowly walked towards him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who is it? What secret do you want to tell?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clever ape-man twisted his body, hopping about, and shouted,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A person entered our tribe, no! It&amp;rsquo;s not a person! Although it looks the same as us, but…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he could finish, the leader suddenly leaned in, face to face, and began to speak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look at me, think carefully, how do you want to say it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You!!!&amp;rdquo; The clever ape-man&amp;rsquo;s pupils dilated abruptly. Looking at the approaching leader, his heart abruptly stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, it was too common for a person to die. The crowd didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the situation and casually discarded the ape-man&amp;rsquo;s corpse in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there was something off with that leader. He might be the human-like. Regrettably, with the death of the clever ape-man, nobody knew of this incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A million years ago, Earth was still thriving with many animals. One day, a cheetah chasing its prey accidentally wandered into a cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it was the cave where the human-like had once taken shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheetah seemed quite curious about the place and started wandering around inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals tend to avoid human crowds, as they can scent human activities. However, this cheetah didn&amp;rsquo;t feel any human presence around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were piles of prey carcasses and some stone artifacts on the cave wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheetah vaguely felt something was wrong. Its underdeveloped brain attempted to make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should have been human activities here, but I can&amp;rsquo;t see or smell anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheetah could not understand and decided to claim this prey as its own. It was about to start its feast when -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A human face appeared out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you looking for me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
