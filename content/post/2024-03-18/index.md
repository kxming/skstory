Seeing oneself is the essence of love from a philosophical standpoint.

Seeing your inherently complete self, you've always been casual, generous, interesting, kind, and uniqueâ€¦ Because of someone's presence, your feelings are awakened. They have stimulated the abilities you always had. When you're in love, you're glowing, but do you love them? What you love, after all, is the glowing self when you're with them. That person you thought was special is an NPC sent by the universe to help you grow, to let you discover the external reality of yourself through inner love, and it requires more inner growth to live lightly.

Humans are a bundle of energy, and the higher the energy, the better the experience of life. How to raise energy? The answer is to radiate more love. I love life, animals, sports, others, and this world. Allow everything to happen. When your heart is filled with beauty, joy, abundance, and wealth, your magnetic field will expand infinitely, and you will receive more rewards from the universe, at that time, the trivial matters of love will no longer trouble your small heart. Everything is a projection of our inner selves. Life has always been about using falsehoods to practice truth and the people and things that make you love and not obtain often hide the lessons you need to complete. When you break free from limiting beliefs, you pass through. The process of breaking and reassembling makes your inner self lighter and often makes you wonder how interesting life is!

I didn't answer love from the perspective of worldly love because, after awakening, I realized it's all just a dream that I wrote, directed, and acted upon myself. What I once thought was destined fate, being pulled by the script of twin flame destiny, inescapable and inseparable yet unable to be together, that kind of depth and tug is indescribably magical. Now, everything is just like ants crawling on the skin, and I can no longer reproduce the tumultuousness of that time.

For me, love is not a carnal affection, it is not about trivial matters; it is an immortal force, the hero's dream in my mundane life.
