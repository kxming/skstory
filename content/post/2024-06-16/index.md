1. All objectivities are subjective, all opinions are biased.

2. If it’s “principally possible,” it means it’s not possible; if it’s “principally not possible,” it actually means it is possible!

3. One must continually grow and progress throughout their life. No matter the path one takes in life, one must persist in learning a new skill.

4. When you encounter something that makes you very angry, take a deep breath, or go to the restroom, and deal with it after you come back. Trust me, this can avoid 90% of future regrets!

5. Admitting one’s shortcomings is not embarrassing; on the contrary, being mediocre yet blindly arrogant is what truly invites disdain.
6. Don’t think that admitting your mistakes will make others think you are foolish. On the contrary, knowing your mistakes but not admitting them will make others see you as stubborn and beyond help. None of the experts I know refuses to admit their mistakes.

7. 10% of life is made up of what happens to you, and 90% is determined by how you react to what happens.

8. If you can’t live the way you want, one day you will come to think in terms of the way you live.

9. Those who have helped you will help you again in times of trouble; those whom you have helped often shut you out when you are in trouble.

10. 99% of things in the world can be solved with money; the remaining 1% requires even more money to solve. If you don’t have money, then find a way to make money.
