As usual, Mako wakes up to a series of data:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Your body temperature is 36 degrees Celsius, blood pressure 112/73 millimeters of mercury, in a good health state. Last night you slept for 7 hours and 19 minutes, of which deep sleep lasted for……&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This voice &amp;lsquo;grew&amp;rsquo; out of her brain. With the maturity of brain-computer interface technology, the electronic secretary created a voice that only one person could &amp;lsquo;hear&amp;rsquo; by stimulating the cortical area of the temporal lobe to simulate auditory impulses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What time is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s 9:55 am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh no! There&amp;rsquo;s a lecture by Masakazu Yoshida today! …What time does it start?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It starts at 10:20 am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Then I must hurry!&amp;rdquo; Mako swiftly threw off the covers, the cold air flooding into her brain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You won&amp;rsquo;t make it, you can&amp;rsquo;t enter after the lecture starts. Even if you hurry now, grooming and travel time will take 35 minutes, you&amp;rsquo;ll arrive at 10:30 am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t understand! It&amp;rsquo;s such a stroke of luck to get a ticket to his lecture! If I hurry now… If I move a bit faster on the road, maybe I could still catch it…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s impossible. Based on previous data and your current indicators, it&amp;rsquo;s calculated that you need 15 minutes to get ready and leave, and the planned route from home to school takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the earliest you can be at the school auditorium is 10:30 am, and this is accurate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What does a machine know? I cannot afford to be late this time!&amp;rdquo; Mako muttered while brushing her teeth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this moment, a smiling face appeared on the mirror of the sink, and the voice of the electronic secretary sounded again: &amp;ldquo;Firstly, the fastest you can arrive at the school auditorium is at 10:30 am, this is the result considering all parameters, there is no possibility of arriving earlier. Secondly, I would like to remind you that I am not just a computer, I am the full data service system developed by the Umbrella Corporation. Although I communicate with you by releasing sound signals through the brain-computer interface, in reality, I can network with every item in your life that contains an Umbrella chip, collect all the data you generate within a day, connect personal data with society databases, thus providing the most comprehensive life services. Our vision at Umbrella is to optimize life and serve the society. Our values are…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako stopped paying attention to the electronic secretary. In the series of coherent actions that followed, she didn&amp;rsquo;t waste any time - the door automatically unlocked after recognizing her fingerprint; she ran to the elevator just as the doors opened; she took the elevator to the first floor, exited the apartment and a car stopped just in front of her, at the moment she seated herself sideways, the vehicle started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between leaving home and getting in the car, not even a second of spare time was left in each step of Mako&amp;rsquo;s journey because the electronic secretary pulled information from the cloud database, and after considering residential elevator usage and city traffic, it sent precise operational commands to the Umbrella chips embedded in the elevator and the car. The entire commute planning system was like precisely meshed gears, filled with an aesthetic of uniformity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako&amp;rsquo;s car had no driver, and she was silently accelerated to 240 kilometers an hour. Looking out the window, the ring road was full of cars, speeding vehicles maintaining a mere 20 centimeters apart. Such a high speed and proximity between the cars turned this stream of vehicles into a real liquid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This liquid could breathe. If a car needed to change lanes or turn, from afar to nearby, dozens of surrounding vehicles would gradually make space for it, clearing the way, like a well-drained Roman triplex formation, without the need for a commander&amp;rsquo;s coordination, as each soldier in the formation knew what to do next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Passing by a vast advertising slogan: &amp;ldquo;Smart City - A city with a heartbeat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before the school auditorium came into view. Mako hurried out of the car and stepped onto the first step in front of the auditorium, looking up at the huge electronic clock overhead, it was 10:29 am.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two seconds later, the numbers flickered gently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>10:30 am, right on time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to being late, Mako could not enter the auditorium, so she had to ask a fellow student from the school office to find her a seat backstage. Even so, she could feel the lively atmosphere of the venue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In conclusion, I would like to say to the youth present, you are lucky to be living in this well-ordered era! Humanity is experiencing stability and convenience like never before. This is the fruit of your parents&amp;rsquo; struggles and contributions, and it&amp;rsquo;s also the mission that you all continue to carry on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the speaker&amp;rsquo;s voice faded, thunderous applause filled the auditorium. Without a doubt, the lecture was a success, and the school office staff finally breathed a sigh of relief - not even halfway through the year, and three students had already jumped off the dormitory roof to their deaths. Over the past decade, suicide rates, shootings, alcohol abuse, and drug cases in universities worldwide have been slowly rising. There were various speculations, but no consensus. Masakazu Yoshida is elegant and understated, rarely participating in public lectures. This time the school office went to great lengths to invite him to give a motivational talk in an attempt to reverse the growing sense of despondency among college students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The host took over the microphone: &amp;ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Yoshida, for your inspiring lecture. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the Q&amp;amp;A session, the direction of questions is not limited. The student there… wearing a blue jacket and glasses, I see you were the first to raise your hand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hello, Mr. Yoshida. You just said that we live in an orderly era… I believe you are referring to the era of full data. As a creator of the new era, could you share with us your most direct feelings about the changes in times? What has been the biggest change?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After listening, Masakazu Yoshida pondered for a moment: &amp;ldquo;If I had to describe the past era with one word, I would choose &amp;lsquo;chaos.&amp;rsquo; The world has changed rapidly in these years, and you can&amp;rsquo;t imagine the world of my childhood because you didn&amp;rsquo;t experience it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In the past, it took over two and a half hours just to travel from the south to the north of the city due to poor traffic and congestion; and when someone fell seriously ill, they had to queue at the hospital for a famous doctor. If one doctor did not succeed, they would have to queue for another at a different hospital. Many people delay their treatment like this. There were also fraudsters everywhere - financial scams, telecommunications fraud, internet scams… Every day countless frauds took away people&amp;rsquo;s life savings, and then the scammers vanished without a trace, and the police were powerless against them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In the world before the era of full data, this was the chaos people faced. As the name suggests, the era of full data means that the data generated by everyone every day is collected and uploaded to a central database. Using these data and results derived from data processing, we can provide people with better lives. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t accomplished overnight; countless engineers and scientists have contributed their wisdom to the advent of the age of full data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;At the beginning of the 21st century, IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) was the first to apply big data technology to medicine. They developed IBM Watson, a cognitive computing system that can read through thousands of medical journals within minutes, compare massive cases in the database, and find the best treatment plan. As a result, big data medicine became popular, and humanity gradually moved away from depending solely on doctors for diagnosis and treatment. &amp;lsquo;Famous doctors&amp;rsquo; were no longer scarce resources; cloud-based diagnosis and treatment, dependent on computer systems, opened to everyone, and were more accurate and transparent. This approach provided patients not just with time but also hope for life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Then, there was the autonomous driving field. Originally, the technology barrier for autonomous driving was very high due to the many random events on the roads. Before, we hoped cars could respond to emergencies in an instant by equipping each one with a sensitive LiDAR and a central system that could react quickly. However, this also meant high costs and the possibility of errors. Looking at the autonomous cars mass-produced and used today, they don&amp;rsquo;t have radars at all, and their control systems use chips at the personal computer level. This is because Google changed the research approach - though developing an autonomous car is difficult, if the entire city&amp;rsquo;s cars are self-driven, and the traffic is treated as a whole, then it&amp;rsquo;s another matter. Connected through networks, collecting and analyzing the position and speed information of each car, the networked car technology has made each vehicle a cell in a massive organism, with higher-level commands given by the central system, so no collisions will occur. This not only solves safety issues but also the cloud database contains the position and routes of all vehicles in the city, as well as reading the vehicles&amp;rsquo; historical records, each person&amp;rsquo;s travel habits, and driving patterns. With macro-management algorithms, the overall city&amp;rsquo;s traffic is planned, optimizing vehicle routes to maximize road utilization rate, therefore, the city is no longer plagued by congestion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Of course, Chinese entrepreneurs and engineers did not want to lag in exploring the application of big data. With the rise of e-commerce at the beginning of the 21st century, China, a large country with billions of people, had major logistical challenges. For example, when everyone rushed to shop at the Singles Day discount, how to deliver each order to buyers as quickly as possible during an explosion of orders? The solution was simple: read all past customer data, predict the purchase situation for each merchant&amp;rsquo;s goods for the year, and then create warehouse distribution plans before the big sales. Before Singles Day arrived, sellers had already placed goods in different warehouses in South China, North China, and East China based on forecast data; logistics companies&amp;rsquo; delivery workers and vehicles were also positioned according to the predicted data. The average delivery time was reduced from a week to three days, significantly speeding up the national logistics network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In this way, big data applications slowly permeated every corner of society: elevator systems collected residents&amp;rsquo; work schedules to optimize the operation and reduce waiting time; analyzing individual search terms and video viewing types to project user interests and preferences then deliver precise ads; smart toilets daily monitored excrement, recording personal health conditions, serving as part-time personal doctors, and could also provide the government with epidemic warnings…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;To summarize - accurate data records of individuals can improve personal lives; massive data records of groups can optimize resource allocation. We have &amp;lsquo;calculated&amp;rsquo; the life we want using big data technology, and in this way, we have finally bid farewell to chaos. This is the change I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed over the years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Yoshida, for taking us through the detailed review of the full data era&amp;rsquo;s inception,&amp;rdquo; the host continued, addressing the audience, &amp;ldquo;So, the next question… Okay, the student in the red sweater there, please pass the microphone to him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hello, Mr. Yoshida. As a university graduate about to step out of school, I am curious why you decided to enter the credit industry at that time. I have read many articles about you; back then you decisively gave up graduate admission from an Ivy League school and a high-paying offer from a top investment firm to start a new company in a niche industry. How were you considering at that time? Did you have full confidence in success?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How could there be one hundred percent confidence before starting?&amp;rdquo; Masakazu Yoshida said with a smile, pushing his glasses, and Mako saw the intelligent crow&amp;rsquo;s feet at the corner of his eyes from the screen, &amp;ldquo;But I did see the trend at that time. We all know if businesses or individuals need loans, financial institutions will carry out a credit rating on them to determine the loan amount, interest rates, and period. In the past, credit ratings were usually done by credit bureaus, analyzing past large loan records, income levels, and asset size, then rigidly adopting formulas to rate; this not only required manual statistics but also could not avoid systemic errors. In contrast, my company, Umbrella, broke down the credit process on the Internet and integrated it into the everyday work and life of borrowers. Every individual&amp;rsquo;s every purchase, every monthly credit card record, salary transfer record, and every company&amp;rsquo;s transfer records became the basis for credit assessment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;However, if just that, it would still not be outstanding. Umbrella innovatively incorporated concepts such as genetic testing, personality tests, academic performance, romantic history, criminal records, and performance assessments all unrelated to finance into the credit system. Many academic studies have confirmed that a person&amp;rsquo;s trustworthiness in borrowing is related to their genes, personality, intellect, and even the level of loyalty in a romantic relationship. We gather all financial and non-financial information of an individual and algorithmically generate credit ratings. Compared to traditional credit, this is a more realistic and universal rating, which not only better reflects financial risks but is also applicable to other non-financial settings; it can be said to be versatile.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;For instance…can it be used for dating?&amp;rdquo; asked the student in the red sweater.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Haha…as expected of young people, always concerned about love. Yes, before a girl accepts your proposal, she can check your dating credit record. If you have a history of infidelity or if all your ex-partners think you&amp;rsquo;re inconsiderate, then of course she will friend-zone you. Besides that, school admissions, company hiring, and business cooperation can all make use of this comprehensive credit system. Umbrella achieved a unified credit system in human society for the first time. From then on, every individual and every company has to be responsible for every decision they make, this is epoch-making for the advancement of societal civilization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;However, the premise of the full data credit is the enormous task of data collection a single enterprise cannot complete it alone. Therefore, I proposed the political sphere, and with the government&amp;rsquo;s encouragement, the International Data Cooperation Act was passed at the United Nations headquarters. The act consists of a preamble and 26 articles, establishing 4 basic principles:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fairness: All data generated by everyone&amp;rsquo;s daily actions will be collected, regardless of profession and background;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sharing: After an individual&amp;rsquo;s data is collected, it will be shared to a cloud database, available for use by all enterprises and institutions worldwide;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Privacy: Personal data must be encrypted before it can be analyzed, and no enterprise or individual has the right to access targeted personal data. All terminal devices, including electronic secretaries, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent electronic devices, only receive the results of issued commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Freedom: Individuals may purchase their data for a specific period to prevent it from being collected and stored, as long as it does not contravene laws or the interests of others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The host then said: &amp;ldquo;The milestone significance of the International Data Cooperation Act is self-evident! After its inception, the world has become transparent, we precisely describe and serve every individual with data, use it to improve living standards, and even predict future black swan events to prevent them. The stable and harmonious era of full data has finally arrived.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Masakazu Yoshida nodded slightly in agreement: &amp;ldquo;I think, my achievement is not so much in creating a large enterprise, but in promoting society into the full data era. Umbrella&amp;rsquo;s chips, developed by our company, are embedded in necessary items like refrigerators, shoe soles, rice cookers, lights, etc., to collect the data generated at every moment. They are also interconnected through the internet, continuously providing us with the most targeted services. This is probably why I was invited today to return to my alma mater to give this lecture… I hope everyone is satisfied with this answer. So, what&amp;rsquo;s the next question?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Q&amp;amp;A session on stage was still underway, Mako&amp;rsquo;s attention was drawn to a shadow in the backstage area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She was standing in the corridor next to the backstage makeup room when a figure in a black hoodie tiptoed into Huang Zhaojing&amp;rsquo;s makeup room. Mako glanced inside through the door gap; there was no one else in the room, and the shadow was rummaging in front of a man&amp;rsquo;s jacket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She had stumbled upon a thief. She hurried into the makeup room and demanded: &amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shadow paused, then replied: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t make a sound.&amp;rdquo; Shortly thereafter, they pulled a flat accessory the size of an eraser from Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s jacket pocket. The brim of the thief&amp;rsquo;s hat was pressed so low that their entire face was shrouded in shadow. A hand swiftly reached out from the shadows, grabbed Mako&amp;rsquo;s wrist, and despite her resistance, dragged her outside and into a car.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout this process, she heard the noise accompanied by the school office staff&amp;rsquo;s shouting from backstage:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s going on?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t we have a record check for students before they entered?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Quick, get control of him first!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She turned to the shadow: &amp;ldquo;What did you just take?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While starting the car, the shadow replied succinctly: &amp;ldquo;Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s mobile database, which is also evidence of his unauthorized intrusion into the public database.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The car left the school gate, and the figure finally pulled down their hood, revealing themselves as Mako&amp;rsquo;s classmate from the mathematics department, Lin Youjie. Seeing a familiar face from campus, Mako relaxed a bit. Although they hadn&amp;rsquo;t interacted before, she had heard of him. Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s reputation was tied to key phrases like &amp;ldquo;rich second generation,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;math genius,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;eccentric behavior.&amp;rdquo; While she contemplated ways to escape, she realized her Umbrella chip was voice-controlled. How could she discreetly send a location signal to the cloud without Lin Youjie noticing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Are you Lin Youjie? From the math department, right? …What exactly do you want?!&amp;rdquo; she demanded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Quite a few questions… Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m Lin Youjie, from the math department. I&amp;rsquo;ll answer your third question later. Tell me your name first.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;My name is Mako…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lin Youjie connected the mobile accessory he had stolen from Masakazu Yoshida to his mobile computer, and the pre-set program started running automatically. The silence in the car was awkward. Mako noticed that she had no signal on her mobile phone, and whispering to her electronic secretary elicited no response. She looked up in a panic, only to receive an expected response.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t bother trying. I&amp;rsquo;ve blocked your phone and electronic secretary. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased the data trajectory for the next 100 hours for both of us. During this time, none of the information you generate will be uploaded to the cloud.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He purchased the data trajectory for 100 hours. Mako was shocked. Although the International Data Cooperation Act clearly stated that paying a certain fee could preserve one&amp;rsquo;s data from being recorded in the cloud, the cost for this privilege has remained prohibitively expensive over the years. Complete data isolation for one-hour costs about the weekly salary of an average office worker. When &amp;ldquo;connection to everything&amp;rdquo; had become the trend of the age, &amp;ldquo;disconnection and isolation&amp;rdquo; had turned into a costly luxury. Growing up in an ordinary salaried family, Mako had only experienced privacy isolation for two and a half hours last year when attending a wealthy friend&amp;rsquo;s birthday party, thanks to her friend&amp;rsquo;s father. She never understood the rich&amp;rsquo;s obsession with their privacy - why fear others knowing if you&amp;rsquo;re not doing anything wrong?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, being granted a hundred hours of privacy isolation out of the blue, she was utterly baffled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rain started to fall outside, pouring onto the windshield as the wipers swung back and forth, trying to clear a view through the veil of rain. Lin Youjie focused on this window, hands on the steering wheel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only then did Mako realize that the car they were in was equipped with a manual driving system!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This car… is manually driven?!&amp;rdquo; she exclaimed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s an old model. Want to listen to some music? There&amp;rsquo;s a CD in the compartment on your left, just slide it into the player,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She shook her head: &amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know how to use that player. Where are you taking me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lin Youjie kept his eyes on the road and didn&amp;rsquo;t answer her. He single-handedly opened the compartment and put the CD into the player.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako was perplexed by how Lin Youjie managed to drive a car at 240 kilometers per hour, weaving through the rhythmic, uniform traffic of autonomous vehicles, finding every gap, dodging in and out, all while being able to put music on. He was like the most jarring noise in a piano piece, with the gray downpour assaulting them upfront, water splashing high into the air from the tires.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re driving dangerously,&amp;rdquo; she said, her palms sweating from nervousness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No, the cars around us controlled by algorithms each have a predetermined trajectory. Understanding the pattern makes it safe. Besides… I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to kidnap you, there was no other way, I need to ask for your help.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s what all kidnappers say to their victims. What exactly did you do in the auditorium? I&amp;rsquo;m not stupid; if you had done nothing wrong, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been keen on driving off with me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lin Youjie did not drive far. After circling the school a few times, he stopped at the coffee shop near the school gate. He motioned for Mako to get out, and they sat down at a table. After ordering drinks, Lin Youjie paid for them with some cash and picked up a book from the shelf, flipping through it while he said to Mako:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I like this coffee shop because they still have these paper books.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Not many people read paper books nowadays. All my books are in electronic format.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So… What kind of books do you like?&amp;rdquo; Lin Youjie shifted his gaze from the pages to Mako&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The recently popular &amp;lsquo;Time Travel in the Deep Palace: The Eighth Princes Love Me&amp;rsquo; is fantastic! There&amp;rsquo;s also &amp;lsquo;The Heiress&amp;rsquo;s Three Lifetimes 2&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Revenge of the Secret Agent Crown Princess.&amp;rsquo; They have very romantic love stories, and the male leads are both handsome and charming. These few books have practically monopolized the market, their advertisements are everywhere… And their intellectual property has been purchased, soon to be adapted on the big screen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If I tell you that I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of these books, would you believe me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Impossible, they&amp;rsquo;re trendy among young people!&amp;rdquo; Mako hesitantly replied, &amp;ldquo;Many of my classmates are reading them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Vulgar literary works always attract attention, but once you&amp;rsquo;ve read a few similar e-books, Umbrella will classify you as an audience for mindless films. Your computer, phone, and any smart billboards you see will push similar content to you according to your &amp;rsquo;taste,&amp;rsquo; and then without realizing it, you become engrossed in cultural junk. Millions of young people are just like you. This feedback is sent back to publishing houses and film production companies, resulting in more and more vulgar books and TV shows being produced. Soon, the cultural market will be inundated with trash. So - extensive real-time data feedback can create this information black box, leading to monotony and ignorance. I&amp;rsquo;ve never allowed them to extract my data, so of course, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be poisoned by such books.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako sneered dismissively: &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s so great about that?… It&amp;rsquo;s just a book to relax with, no need to make a big deal out of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If I tell you that in addition to books and movies, news, knowledge, information, and even your career and life choices have been stuffed into a predictable black box and that Masakazu Yoshida and his Umbrella company are going to be the culprits behind the decay of human society, would you believe that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako looked at Lin Youjie in confusion, taking a moment to respond: &amp;ldquo;…So you&amp;rsquo;re an anti-full-data individual! I noticed earlier; that you&amp;rsquo;re manually driving, you&amp;rsquo;re paying with cash, you&amp;rsquo;re reading physical books - all to avoid leaving a digital trail. I heard in the news that your conservative faction is on the rise. But forgive my frankness, every technological revolution comes with opposition. You&amp;rsquo;re like the Luddites of the 19th century who went around destroying looms. Could they stop the Industrial Revolution? A few looms to an entire era are like grains of sand. Your voice in the full data era is less than even a grain of sand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lin Youjie shook his head helplessly as a waiter brought over a cup of coffee, which Lin Youjie gently slid towards Mako: &amp;ldquo;Here, an espresso, I ordered it for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako brightened slightly at the sight of the coffee: &amp;ldquo;Hmm, thank you. I was wanting this…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Your phone alarm has your routine, indicating you&amp;rsquo;re an early riser and nap-taker; your smart toilet detected your blood sugar levels; your fitness tracker has recorded your heartbeat and temperature; your digital wallet indicated that you had a filling breakfast this morning and you habitually drink espresso to stay alert. Therefore, by analyzing your physical indicators, it can be concluded: that you&amp;rsquo;re feeling sleepy right now and could use a cup of coffee to wake up… Does this cup of coffee meet your expectations?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes… But how were you able to access targeted personal information? According to the International Data Cooperation Act, personal data must be encrypted before being used for algorithmic analysis; no enterprise or individual has the right to access targeted personal data. Are you saying… you hacked into the cloud database?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before Mako&amp;rsquo;s questioning, Lin Youjie remained noncommittal: &amp;ldquo;Every day, there are about 130 people with a reliance on caffeine, just like you, who come to this place for an espresso. With this data, the cafe can adjust inventory and staffing, preparing enough raw materials in advance; IBS (location-based services) have their macro analyses - most students who come here for coffee sit all day. So many students congregating here indicates business opportunities. Hence, bubble tea shops, copy centers, and reading rooms have opened up around, each with significant customer traffic and profit. Students found a study spot, staff earned wages, shops made profits, the school collected rent, the neighborhood became more commercially valuable, and you, Miss Mako, were no longer sleepy this afternoon thanks to a cup of coffee. In this case, full data ensures the most optimal resource allocation and benefits everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako nodded, looking at Lin Youjie with confusion. &amp;ldquo;So, why are you opposing the full data era then? Why do you oppose Masakazu Yoshida?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Because we&amp;rsquo;ll never know if Masakazu Yoshida wants to drink coffee. There&amp;rsquo;s an issue with the &amp;lsquo;Principle of Freedom&amp;rsquo; in the International Data Cooperation Act. Those at the top of the Forbes list can, of course, afford to prevent access to all their personal and family data at any time. But what about the average person? The salaryman? The family of five living in a 40-square-meter space? Privacy? They probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t buy such an intangible thing, would they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So what? I am that average person. So what if all my data is uploaded? I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt any inconvenience…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lin Youjie cut her off: &amp;ldquo;Mako, have you ever considered what determines why some people reach the top of the pyramid while others live paycheck to paycheck every day?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako was taken aback, not expecting such a clichéd question, and said hesitantly, &amp;ldquo;…Successful people are 99% hard work and 1% genius?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do you believe that? We got into top universities, aren&amp;rsquo;t we all Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s juniors? Aren&amp;rsquo;t we diligent? Aren&amp;rsquo;t we talented? Yet after we graduate, 99% of us lead mediocre lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know, the proportion wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly this high during Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do you think all this is caused by the Umbrella company?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s caused by the full data era,&amp;rdquo; Lin Youjie corrected, &amp;ldquo;Today, computers can replace most of the work carried out by humans, whether it&amp;rsquo;s intellectual work or crafts, none is spared. Once algorithms are cracked, even the most talented traders can&amp;rsquo;t compete with computers; as soon as designs are read, the craftsmanship of seasoned artisans doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the precision of machines. So, what&amp;rsquo;s left of human value? - It&amp;rsquo;s the secrets not known to others, the paths once taken, people met, and experiences had, that constitute a person&amp;rsquo;s core value. The key for a person to stand out is not diligence or genius, but privacy. In this era, the difference between elites and the average, the rich and the poor, lies in who controls privacy and data.&amp;rdquo; He paused, &amp;ldquo;But most people won&amp;rsquo;t think about this anymore. Once privacy is uploaded, it means the full data era has robbed them of creativity and reflective ability… And, thanks to my father who has some money, besides buying me a car, also bought me the highest level of privacy protection. Otherwise, I would be like you all, chasing novels and TV shows, not feeling that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with this absurd era.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No wonder they didn&amp;rsquo;t detect your anti-full data tendencies in the auditorium; because all the data… it was never stored in the database at all!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not the point, extended privacy protection has given me the ability to think independently. If a person&amp;rsquo;s preferences are fully transparent, then simply by tweaking a few settings in the city&amp;rsquo;s central computer and conveying them via the electronic secretaries inserted in people&amp;rsquo;s brains, they can be guided to appear in any place, do anything… Their work experience and personal abilities are recorded in the database, replaceable by computers or others at any time, producing nothing of unique value. Thus, they can only do the lowest repetitive tasks in the city&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem, earning just enough to live. Life is like a road with an end in sight; there&amp;rsquo;s no chance and no challenge, and everyone feels the ceiling over them before even graduating, which is why the suicide rate among young people around the world is rising!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Faced with Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s crazy theory, Mako&amp;rsquo;s rationality returned: &amp;ldquo;These are all speculations; where is the evidence?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lin Youjie pondered for a moment: &amp;ldquo;Evidence… I have it. Did you just ask me if I hacked into the cloud database? You give me too much credit. Such databases are maintained year-round by top cybersecurity experts; even with exceptional skills, it would be difficult to find a vulnerability.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Then how did you obtain my data? All service endpoints, whether it&amp;rsquo;s electronic secretaries or others, should receive only the outcomes of cloud data computation; the intermediate process should be a black box!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The mobile hard drive that I just mentioned contains all the updated data from Masakazu Yoshida every day. I used it to forge his identity, and after the cloud database recognized it, I was able to retrieve your information.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The thing you stole backstage just now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lin Youjie nodded: &amp;ldquo;Masakazu Yoshida bought off his data, blocking all of his data from the cloud database, but he also wanted to understand the status of his health, assets, and company operations. How to securely collect the data continuously generated by oneself for personal use? The solution is simple - all data generated by Masakazu Yoshida is collected at the terminal into that small box, existing independently from the outside world in the most primitive form of isolation for data security. But it is also the most unsafe. I only need to steal its physical form… there will be no alarms, and no possibility to remotely format it after it&amp;rsquo;s discovered to be stolen… As long as I have it, I firmly hold Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s secrets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How ironic… In an era where information security is highly emphasized, the theft of top secrets is actually through such a crude method.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lin Youjie nodded: &amp;ldquo;If this gets out, Masakazu Yoshida will spend the rest of his life in prison. Not only that but with this evidence, a comprehensive investigation into Umbrella can be initiated by the government. Once the government&amp;rsquo;s experts analyze a sufficient number of samples, they can also prove that the entire data collection and analysis system is detrimental to human society. It&amp;rsquo;s just… I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I need your help with this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Because there&amp;rsquo;s no time. The moment my face appeared backstage, they would have pinpointed my identity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What should I do now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Finish your espresso. Then, go to my car - a manually driven car is detached from the database. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, they won&amp;rsquo;t find you that quickly - use the notebook in the car with this small black box to access the cloud database. Download the useful information and distribute it to five different media outlets, with the list all on the computer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;And then?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;…You might also want to look at your data in the cloud database, it could be quite interesting!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He stood up and walked out of the coffee shop&amp;rsquo;s door, and his elongated silhouette in the sunshine looked like a straight exclamation mark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time Mako snapped back to reality and raced to the door of the coffee shop, Lin Youjie had vanished, leaving only the manually driven car behind. &amp;ldquo;If &amp;lsquo;being connected to everything&amp;rsquo; has become inevitable, then &amp;lsquo;disconnecting from the system&amp;rsquo; has become the most fragile luxury…&amp;rdquo; she murmured to herself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako entered Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s car and took the computer before anyone could discover her. However, as she walked home with the computer in her arms, a terrifying silence descended upon her. Only an hour had gone by since she had disconnected, and she still had a long time to go before the 100-hour privacy break ended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mobile phone signal was back, but it lacked functionalities like advertisement push and travel planning, now just a bare communication tool, much quieter. There was no telling voice guiding her when to turn left at an intersection, nor did the red traffic lights turn green for her. She had never been caught in the rain before, because her electronic secretary would have planned her itinerary based on weather predictions to avoid her exposure to rain, but today she became a drenched chicken, a lost one at that on the streets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet she felt a thrill, with no electronic secretary&amp;rsquo;s nagging reminders, she learned to be alone for the first time and to listen to her thoughts. For the first time, her life was completely her own; her secrets belonged to her, not to be meddled with by others. But what when the rain stops? When the 100 hours are over?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did she have to return to the predetermined track? When she got home, she opened the portable computer, impersonating Masakazu Yoshida, and logged into the page where all her data was recorded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s the fascination in this? Just a bunch of boring numbers,&amp;rdquo; she said to herself, recalling Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s words. Then an idea flashed through her mind; she checked the computer&amp;rsquo;s hidden folders and found a complex algorithm Lin Youjie had left behind. Subconsciously, she uploaded all her data to the algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An image appeared on the screen - it was Mako herself but aged by ten years. She immediately realized this was a simulation of her future based on past data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scene was set in a villa. She was dressed elegantly, enjoying afternoon tea with a few equally well-dressed ladies, holding bone china cups. Her obedient son and daughter sat by her side, the daughter&amp;rsquo;s eyes like hers, the son&amp;rsquo;s nose like hers. The afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a soft, surreal glow on the house and its occupants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is your future, Miss Mako,&amp;rdquo; a line of text appeared on the computer screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;…Not bad. But it&amp;rsquo;s not interesting to know the future so early!&amp;rdquo; She opened her email to attach the data package containing Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s evidence. Just as she was about to click &amp;lsquo;send email,&amp;rsquo; the villa door on the screen was gently pushed open, and a man stood outside. Only the hand that pushed the door, with a wedding ring, was visible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you want to see who your future husband is?&amp;rdquo; the computer prompted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Never mind, I guess I&amp;rsquo;m not destined to meet him anyway.&amp;rdquo; Mako clicked the &amp;lsquo;send&amp;rsquo; button, and the data recording her actions updated swiftly with a few lines. The beautiful future scene on the screen vanished instantly, replaced by a long silence and a black screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Goodbye, full data era,&amp;rdquo; Mako mumbled to herself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Notice of the Dismissal of Masakazu Yoshida as Chairman&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;During Masakazu Yoshida&amp;rsquo;s tenure as CEO of Umbrella (August 2028 - November 2039), he illegally penetrated the international cloud database and accessed others&amp;rsquo;s information, severely violating the International Data Cooperation Act and adversely affecting the company&amp;rsquo;s image. Now Masakazu Yoshida has been subjected to a court subpoena, and Umbrella will fully cooperate with the related investigations. At the same time, to minimize the impact of this incident on public life, the board of directors has decided, effective immediately, to relieve Masakazu Yoshida of his duties as CEO of Umbrella, with the former Chief Technology Officer taking over the company&amp;rsquo;s operational affairs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mako did not anticipate Umbrella&amp;rsquo;s swift response; they reacted just hours after the news release. Mako continued to scroll down with her mouse but noticed that besides the punishment of Masakazu Yoshida individually, there was no mention of a government investigation into Umbrella&amp;rsquo;s data processing methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The accompanying image in the notice on the website was a photo with a caption noting &amp;ldquo;former CEO of Umbrella cooperates with the investigation.&amp;rdquo; Although the man was wearing the same style suit, and the same glasses, a closer inspection by Mako revealed that he was not Masakazu Yoshida at all!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How is this possible…&amp;rdquo; she murmured, &amp;ldquo;This person is not Masakazu Yoshida, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen his face.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She immediately went online to search for images of Masakazu Yoshida, and all the official photos of him were different from what she remembered. If Mako had never seen Lin Youjie, perhaps she would have doubted her memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Damn it…&amp;rdquo; She quickly sent a video call to Lin Youjie; after the news had come out, he should have been out of danger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her phone screen lit up, and greeting her was a man in a black hoodie, the same warmth, the same handsome look. Except - it was a completely unfamiliar face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She broke out in a cold sweat and quickly hung up the call.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, Mako gradually understood the real meaning behind Lin Youjie&amp;rsquo;s words - that the core value of a person is those unknown privacies. Once all data is extracted, a persona can be painted, machines can mimic all their behaviors, access all their accounts, and simulate a possible future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this time, does it matter who is who, whether their physical bodies exist?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Masakazu Yoshida may have never existed, just an image tool presented by Umbrella for PR purposes, or maybe he did exist once, but could easily be made a scapegoat and vanish into a wisp of history. And so could she. If a mathematics student who drives a manual car, doesn&amp;rsquo;t read e-books and only pays with cash can be defined as Lin Youjie, then a girl who reads romantic novels and is late for seminars can be defined as Mako.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for how she will be replaced by whom and in what way in the tide of the full data era, it remains unknown. An electronic secretary could control her whereabouts in any manner and guide her to live or die because she is transparent, yet she knows nothing on the other end of the scale. She used to think that data was a tool for convenience, after meeting Lin Youjie she thought data was a shortcut for some people, but now she finally understood that data itself is power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And she no longer had the chance to tell anyone these realizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the 100 hours of privacy coverage had passed, the voice of the electronic secretary rose in her mind: &amp;ldquo;Hello, Miss Mako, we meet again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the first time, Mako felt truly alone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Virtual Life</title><link>https://www.skstory.online/p/virtual-life/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 18:52:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.skstory.online/p/virtual-life/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UnijjfZ4pT5tdvnIcL47DQ.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Virtual Life" />&lt;p>Kev was driving on the road with his wife and child.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as the three were happily chatting, an accident happened with a large truck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The violent impact made Kev lose consciousness instantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mr. Kev, your virtual life experience ends here, you lived 38 years, we look forward to your experience of the next life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Dad, our teacher posed a riddle during class today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What riddle?&amp;rdquo; Kev, gripping the steering wheel, smiled and glanced at his laughing son Ian in the rearview mirror.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What in the world is the longest yet shortest, the fastest yet slowest, the most divisible yet most extensive, and the most often overlooked yet most regrettable?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev considered this for a moment, then said, &amp;ldquo;Dad can&amp;rsquo;t figure it out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mum, can you guess?&amp;rdquo; Ian turned his wide eyes towards his mother Carla.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mom doesn&amp;rsquo;t know either.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hehe, it&amp;rsquo;s time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;My son is so clever.&amp;rdquo; Kev, turning his head to praise his son, heard a sudden outcry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Kev! Watch out!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simultaneously with his wife&amp;rsquo;s shout, Kev looked ahead only to see a roaring truck heading straight for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time seemed to slow down at that moment. Even the transmission of sound became sluggish. Kev could see the head of the truck deforming due to the collision and the horrified expression of the truck driver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Immediately after, the windshield shattered. Countless glass shards rushed towards Kev and his family. Kev instinctively threw himself in front of his wife and son, but it was of no avail. The sensation of weightlessness soon followed. It was as if the car was in a tumble dryer, tossing Kev around the corners of the car.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev knew that the car was flipping in the air. His mind was blank. With a few violent impacts, Kev finally lost consciousness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev slowly opened his eyes and came close to a shiny metal plate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Where am I?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev tried to move his limbs but found he was enclosed in a metal box. With the memory of the accident flashing back, a word suddenly came to his mind - coffin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Am I… Am I in a coffin?&amp;rdquo; wondered Kev.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon after, the metal plate was lifted, and Kev was hit with a blinding light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mr. Davis, are you alright?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev listened to the stranger in a suit, his mind recalling fragments of the scene before the accident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What about my wife and son? How are they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man in the suit seemed taken aback for a moment, and then responded, &amp;ldquo;You mean Carla and Ian?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, where are they?&amp;rdquo; Kev asked anxiously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, they are virtual characters in your deep learning session, what you might call intelligent AI.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev processed the man&amp;rsquo;s words slowly, trying to reconcile the shattered pieces of his memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the doctors behind the man in the suit spoke up: &amp;ldquo;Mr. Davis, this time your consciousness deep learning virtual life length was 38 years, from birth to death. Mr. Davis, this time your consciousness deep learning simulation lasted for 38 years. The ending of your virtual life was considerable; a car accident due to distracted driving resulted in your death. We trust you should have a deep impression of traffic rules in your head now, as a result. Always remember to obey traffic rules in real life because you only get one life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev was left sitting alone in the cabin, the reality of his situation sinking in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deep learning consciousness, virtual life, reality…&amp;quot; These series of words were constantly stimulating the memory in Kev&amp;rsquo;s mind until all the memories were strung together into a thread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I remember…&amp;rdquo; Kev&amp;rsquo;s expression began to calm down: &amp;ldquo;The doctor just told me my virtual life lasted for thirty-eight years. But wasn&amp;rsquo;t it stated in the contract that it guarantees a forty-year life experience? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you be refunding the money for the two missing years?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mr. Kev,&amp;rdquo; the man in the suit said as he pulled out the contract as if he had anticipated Kev&amp;rsquo;s question, &amp;ldquo;The contract clearly states that if death is due to force majeure, we will compensate. However, if it results from personal behavior, you will have to deal with the consequences. Running a red light that caused an accident falls under your behavior. Therefore, our company reserves the right not to compensate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev initially wanted to argue with the man in the suit. Seeing his prepared demeanor and because the two missing years of his virtual life experience might not have significant learnings, he reluctantly backed off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev left the cabin and checked the time on his watch. Only ten minutes had passed since he had entered the cabin for deep learning. This was the advantage of deep learning consciousness - needing just a dozen minutes to experience decades&amp;rsquo; worth of time in a virtual conscious world. During this virtual period, consciousness would learn different knowledge and experience different aspects of life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking around, Kev saw similar cabins dotted across the entire hall. There was a multitude of such deep learning halls in the city, yet despite their number, they were still insufficient to cater to the turnout of people eager to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From when did learning require just resources and no effort? People from the past fantasized about such a possibility, and now in the present, traditional ways of learning have become meaningless. Everyone had to keep up with the trend by joining the rat race and finding better jobs or else being left behind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, to prevent virtual life from corrupting people&amp;rsquo;s consciousness, causing mental disturbances, and blurring the lines between virtual and reality, the device defaulted to blocking the individual&amp;rsquo;s real-world memories. Thus, the trajectory of virtual life became arbitrary. Sometimes, those with less favorable luck would have to undergo deep learning multiple times to gain the desired skills or knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, the cycle for everyone was earning money from learning, using the knowledge to make more money, and using more money to acquire more knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev was no exception. His short ten-minute learning experience had depleted more than half of his savings and had even accrued him a significant amount of debt. But now, armed with the knowledge of a high-level engineer, Kev could apply for a high-paying job in any tech company. Maybe it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long for his learning expenditure to be recouped, possibly even exceeding the previous amount.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Walking through the bustling crowd, Kev began to envision a better future life. He confidently began to look for jobs on his phone. The sorrow of losing his wife and child in a car accident in his virtual life seemed to have only lasted for a moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, all Kev wants to do is land a good job, pay off the debt, and enjoy life. Thoughts of marriage and childbirth are no longer important since he had already experienced them in his virtual life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed your resume and confirmed that you do indeed possess the qualifications of a senior engineer from your deep learning experience. However, since your specialized knowledge is rather limited, our preference leans toward individuals with more versatile skills. Therefore, you do not fully meet our recruitment conditions…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev was squatting on the stairs, replaying the recruiter&amp;rsquo;s words and his professional fake smile in his mind. He looked at the many unsent resumes in his hands. He had assumed that spending so much money on gaining life experience would pave a golden road for him, but the reality turned out to be much harsher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So real life is very different from virtual life…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps during those short ten minutes when Kev was in virtual life, countless people had progressed and surpassed him. But this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the worst part. The worst part was that the only way to break out of this situation was to figure out how to go through more rounds of deep learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hey, buddy, are you here for an interview?&amp;rdquo; A tall, thin man had somehow ended up by Kev&amp;rsquo;s side and was peeping curiously at Kev&amp;rsquo;s resumes with a smirk on his face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; Kev was feeling annoyed and quickly covered and returned his resume to his pocket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I can tell the result was not good from your expression, am I right?&amp;rdquo; The tall, thin man sat down leisurely beside Kev with a signed job contract on his lap, &amp;ldquo;Let me guess, because of limited specialized knowledge?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev glanced at the tall, thin man. He still had an unpleasant grin on his face, and his small eyes were constantly checking Kev out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do we know each other?&amp;rdquo; Kev asked coldly, hoping to drive the man away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Not. But I was once just like you, hitting a wall everywhere I went. I thought I could land a job after one round of deep learning.&amp;rdquo; The skinny man picked up the signed job contract on his lap and changed the subject, &amp;ldquo;Who would have thought I could land a job that other people work hard for so easily.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you came to flaunt, I think you&amp;rsquo;ve found the wrong person.&amp;rdquo; Kev got up, preparing to leave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I just thought we had a connection,&amp;rdquo; The tall, thin man pulled out a white paper from his bag, &amp;ldquo;If you want to solve your current problems, go to the address on this paper and find a person named William, you&amp;rsquo;ll thank me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev never believed in getting something for nothing, so he didn&amp;rsquo;t take the paper. The man left the paper on the step and walked away with a shake of his head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watching the tall, thin man&amp;rsquo;s disappearing back, Kev let out a sigh of relief. His eyes caught sight of the paper on the step and driven by an inexplicable curiosity, he picked it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev squatted down and picked up the paper. It read &amp;ldquo;Industrial Area, Fourth Street, №223.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you want to solve your current problems…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The words of the tall, thin man echoed unusually in Kev&amp;rsquo;s mind, like a persistent fly he couldn&amp;rsquo;t swat away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev looked at the white paper in his hand, hesitated, and finally made a decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m heading to Industrial Area, Fourth Street, 223.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>industrial Zone - A place Kev had never set foot in. In an era when everyone can be a high-end intellectual, the industrial zone was the first to realize fully automated operation, which also made it the first place that lost the warmth of humanity. Today, only some vagrants and those who can&amp;rsquo;t see the light coexist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thinking about this, Kev suddenly had some regrets. Seeing those rambled vagrants outside the window. Some walked aimlessly with distorted bodies, some crouched in wall corners shaking, as if they were all as insane as those in psychiatric hospitals. This made Kev not dare to meet their eyes, fearing that he would be pulled off the bus and robbed of all his possessions the next second.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Young man, if I may ask, what are you doing here?&amp;rdquo; The driver asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m looking for someone,&amp;rdquo; Kev answered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Looking for someone here? Do you know what kind of people are here?&amp;rdquo; The driver looked back and said: &amp;ldquo;This place is full of people left behind by the times, all are unscrupulous men who are willing to risk their lives for money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Just drive and don&amp;rsquo;t look back.&amp;rdquo; Kev patted the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat and said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, my virtual life during deep learning was a racing driver.&amp;rdquo; The driver said proudly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Then why are you driving a taxi here? Aren&amp;rsquo;t you participating in professional competitions?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is no longer the era of matching supply and demand. If this were in the past… especially in the early days of deep learning, I would have a chance to shine.&amp;rdquo; The driver patted the steering wheel and said: &amp;ldquo;But now it&amp;rsquo;s not possible, if I want to enter professional racing, in addition to being a capable driver, I also need to have a lot of other skills in repair and business. Almost one person is a whole team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In other words, people who have only experienced deep learning once, aren&amp;rsquo;t much different from these people who haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to do deep learning?&amp;rdquo; Kev said, looking at the vagrants outside the car window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There is a bit of difference, otherwise, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t encounter me. In this era, the vast majority of people are like me, stuck in a position that is better than a vagrant but not as good as an outstanding elite, and can only do some ordinary jobs…&amp;rdquo; The driver stopped the car gradually as he was talking: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at №223.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outside the car window was an abandoned factory. Even the original factory brand had become blurry. There were many such abandoned factories in the industrial zone, all of which were historical buildings left behind by the impact of full automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Are you sure the address is correct?&amp;rdquo; The driver looked out the window at the dilapidated environment with some worry: &amp;ldquo;Are there people in this place?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev took out the piece of paper again and confirmed that the address was correct, then paid the driver and got out of the car. Not until Kev walked into the factory did the driver start the car to leave. Even Kev himself was a little hesitant. Are there people here?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inside of the factory was very spacious. The puddles everywhere on the ground made the surrounding environment very damp and cold. Perhaps only the huge safety signs on the wall still remembered the spectacular scene of a hundred people working at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev walked aimlessly toward the depths of the factory. He didn&amp;rsquo;t know where his destination was, let alone to find a man named William.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps human curiosity always coincides with the inevitable direction of events. Kev&amp;rsquo;s eyes were attracted by an inconspicuous iron door in the corner. He walked up and knocked on the door on a whim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev himself didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that a pair of eyes suddenly appear in the small window of the door.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Can I help you?&amp;rdquo; The person inside asked, sounding very alert.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I… came to find William,&amp;rdquo; Kev answered tentatively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Are you alone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo; Kev nodded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The eyes inside the door changed noticeably at the mention of the name &amp;ldquo;William&amp;rdquo;, but he still looked around carefully behind Kev&amp;rsquo;s back, apparently checking to see if there were any other people around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly, the small window was closed again, and then there was a series of unlocking sounds from behind the door. From the sound, there was certainly more than one lock behind the door.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The door opened, and a man in a plaid shirt appeared in front of Kev.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Come in.&amp;rdquo; The man waved his hand to beckon, and after Kev entered, he quickly locked the door.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev sized up this William. He had a rough beard, and his hair was also greasy. His plaid shirt was very dirty, full of sweat and grease stains that had soaked in and dried out again and again. Even his slippers might break in half at any time during the &amp;ldquo;plop plop&amp;rdquo; walking process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The air inside the room was turbid. The mixed smell of fermented food and cigarettes came from the beer bottles and lunch boxes scattered around, and the cigarette butts piled up like a mountain on the table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do you smoke?&amp;rdquo; The man pulled out a box of cigarettes and handed it to Kev.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No thanks.&amp;rdquo; Kev declined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev smokes in his normal life, but because the man&amp;rsquo;s living environment is unsightly, Kev subconsciously rejects the man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So, you are William?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man nodded, then lit a cigarette for himself and threw the box onto the table: &amp;ldquo;William is a pseudonym, but you can call me that if you want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hearing that William was the man&amp;rsquo;s pseudonym, Kev couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but be startled. Who uses a pseudonym in this day and age besides criminals? Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a smoker&amp;rsquo;s habit, but Kev unintentionally glanced at the cigarette box and found that it was an expensive luxury product. This detail, which didn&amp;rsquo;t match the man&amp;rsquo;s living conditions at all, made Kev more certain that what the man was doing was extraordinary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;These cigarettes are quite expensive, aren&amp;rsquo;t they?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Smoking a cigarette, William chuckled: &amp;ldquo;This is my only hobby. By the way… how did you find me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I was introduced here by a tall and thin man. He said you could solve my problem.&amp;rdquo; Kev replied, and then thought for a moment and added: &amp;ldquo;The problem of finding a job.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do you know what I do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No clue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Let me show you first.&amp;rdquo; William didn&amp;rsquo;t hide anything and went straight to the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He got up and walked towards a black plastic at the corner of the room, then gently lifted it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at what was under the plastic cloth, Kev opened his eyes in surprise - it was a consciousness-deep learning machine. Although the surface of the machine was somewhat rusty, and some wires were wrapped with tape, it looked just like the machines in the learning hall overall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pointing at the learning machine and then at William, Kev said: &amp;ldquo;This thing…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is exactly what I do. This thing can be understood as a pirated deep learning machine.&amp;rdquo; William patted the shell of the learning machine, making a &amp;ldquo;clanging&amp;rdquo; sound.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Where did you get this?&amp;rdquo; Kev stepped forward and carefully looked at this pirated learning machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I stole it from a scrap yard. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a simple repair. It&amp;rsquo;s almost no different from the normal learning machine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is illegal,&amp;rdquo; Kev said nervously, his voice much quieter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Of course, I know it&amp;rsquo;s illegal, and I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one doing this.&amp;rdquo; William covered the black plastic cloth back on it, then walked back to the couch, sat down, and lit another cigarette: &amp;ldquo;So I didn&amp;rsquo;t force you to be complicit. You only need to pay a fiftieth of the regular fee to use my learning machine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev quickly calculated in his head. Based on his current savings, he could use this pirated learning machine nearly fifty times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does it mean to perform fifty deep learnings? Kev had not thought about it in detail. As far as he knew, no one in the world had performed deep learning more than ten times. Thinking about this, Kev started to doubt the authenticity of the learning machine in front of him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Has there ever been a problem with this pirate machine?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William languidly leaned back on the couch and exhaled smoke into the air: &amp;ldquo;The machine I can guarantee you because there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been any problem so far, but there are some things to be careful about when it comes to users.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What to be careful about?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In the regular learning hall, the machines all have a so-called virtual-reality isolation device, which is designed to prevent users from mixing real-world memories in the virtual life, thus causing mental and cognitive confusion. This is one of the core technologies of the learning machine, which ensures that people can repeatedly use the learning machine without burden.&amp;rdquo; William extinguished the cigarette on the table again: &amp;ldquo;But this scrapped machine does not have such a protective device. Simply put, people who use my learning machine can possess real-world memories in their virtual life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hearing this, Kev finally realized why he could quickly step out of the virtual life in which he had lost his wife and children due to a car accident. So, he immediately excitedly asked: &amp;ldquo;In this way, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t the course of the virtual life be dominated by the user? In other words, can the user do whatever they want in the virtual world?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hmm… indeed.&amp;rdquo; William stared straight at Kev: &amp;ldquo;So, I suggest that it is best not to perform deep learning more than five times on this machine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Five times? How could such a good thing be used only five times?&amp;rdquo; Kev was very puzzled by this. He had already ignored the messy environment and sat on the chair by moving aside the beer bottles on it. At this moment, all his attention was on this learning machine that might bring him everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;As I just said, there are no problems with the machine. The key is people. Without the protection of virtual-reality isolation, after many deep learning exercises, users&amp;rsquo; mental states will have various problems, big and small. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to cause any trouble because of this. Moreover, the five times I mentioned is just an approximation, some people have problems after using it once.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve used it yourself, haven&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo; Kev asked: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that you&amp;rsquo;ve used it less than five times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Me? Why would I use it?&amp;rdquo; William shrugged: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the man dealing in illegal deals. All I need is to make money off of you guys. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect to get any psychological comfort from me. Let me tell you, I tell you the risk out of goodwill. The risk is for you to bear. Moreover, others who do this kind of trade may not necessarily tell you the risk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As William said, Kev was planning to find some comfort from him, to prove that there would be no problem with this learning machine, but it seemed that William was not going to give him that reassurance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Can I use it once now?&amp;rdquo; Kev thought for a moment and said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Just pay the money.&amp;rdquo; William stretched lazily, rubbing his fingers in front of Kev.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without a word, Kev took out his wallet and handed a stack of cash to William.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After receiving the money, William did not count it but placed it on the table casually. After smoking the last puff of the cigarette, he stood up and walked to the learning machine, clicked the control panel, and said: &amp;ldquo;The cleanliness is not as good as the regular machine. After all, all sorts of people have used it before. I hope you are okay with that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After saying this, William pulled open the metal plate of the learning machine to reveal the internal cabin of the learning machine. Inside the cabin, except for some messy wiring and occasional hints of odd smell, it was no different from the one in the learning hall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev frowned and climbed into the cabin. William sorted out the wires from a spider web-like bundle and pasted them on Kev&amp;rsquo;s head and body in order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cold electrodes made Kev nervous again. He swallowed his saliva and said, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re sure there&amp;rsquo;s no problem, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There won&amp;rsquo;t be any problem, rest assured.&amp;rdquo; After William said this, he covered the metal plate, leaving Kev alone inside the cabin listening to his increasingly rapid heartbeat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Three, two, one! Start!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William&amp;rsquo;s countdown reached Kev&amp;rsquo;s ears through the metal plate, and the next second, Kev felt the originally cramped cabin start to soften. The air around him seemed to be replaced by some kind of fluid. Kev wanted to leave the cabin but found himself completely powerless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as Kev was about to suffocate, a force suddenly pulled him out of the cabin. The bright light made his eyes squint, all he could hear was laughter all around him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Congratulations, it&amp;rsquo;s a boy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon hearing this, Kev suddenly realized he had successfully entered the virtual world and began a virtual life as a newborn. If it were not for his real memories, the experience of being born from his mother wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as clear as it is now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a long time, Kev&amp;rsquo;s eyes gradually adjusted to the light. He opened his eyes and observed everything around him. Within his sight, apart from the soft quilt, a woman with a sweaty head gently looked at him - no doubt this woman was Kev&amp;rsquo;s mother in the virtual world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though Kev&amp;rsquo;s real memories only exist in the consciousness of his brain and could not manifest in the body of a newborn baby, this did not hinder Kev&amp;rsquo;s growth in the subsequent times like a child prodigy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When he was ten years old, Kev&amp;rsquo;s adult-like behaviors worried his parents a great deal. From their perspective, Kev was a smart child. However, that cleverness had a sense of maturity as if he had forgotten to drink Mengpo soup in his previous life. Fortunately, Kev became aware of this and made some changes. Otherwise, his virtual childhood might constantly be dealing with psychologists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As such, for most of the time in his virtual life, Kev has to decipher the different reactions to daily life at various ages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In his twenties, Kev, who had planned to reach the pinnacle of life in the virtual world, suddenly changed his mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps the enactment of the past twenty-odd years of virtual life has compressed Kev, or perhaps the experiences in real life left him with nowhere to vent. Kev, in his current state, is not keen on learning all kinds of knowledge that can improve himself but decided to be a carefree whirlpool, drawing from life&amp;rsquo;s experiences that have always floated on the surface and been totally out of reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In his thirties, amidst the strange gazes of people in his virtual life, Kev experiences the rebelliousness of youth and the indulgence of being an adult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, just when Kev thought he could keep playing until the end of this virtual life, he had an accident during a motorcycle race.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before he could react, he was already flying in the air unable to differentiate between up and down, left and right. Not until his body fell heavily on the ground did he realize he had a car accident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The smell of blood filled his nose and mouth, he struggled to get up, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t have the energy to do anything but his eyeballs. This reminded him of the car accident in his previous virtual life, the pain in his body at that time was no different than the current pain, it hurt so much that his soul was torn apart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>……&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev opened his eyes wildly and pushed open the metal plate. Unlike his reaction after waking up in a regular learning hall last time, Kev showed no panic after awakening this time, however, he was still breathing heavily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That was quick?&amp;rdquo; William, holding a cigarette, said with a surprised tone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How long has it been?&amp;rdquo; Kev tried to calm down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying attention. I haven&amp;rsquo;t even finished a cigarette, and you&amp;rsquo;re already out.&amp;rdquo; William said, handing Kev a cigarette, &amp;ldquo;Do you want to smoke now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev silently took the cigarette, took out his lighter lit it, and took a deep breath, &amp;ldquo;I killed myself in a motorcycle race.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William was taken aback, then also lit a cigarette for himself and said, &amp;ldquo;Did you die instantly?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev squinted his eyes and countered, &amp;ldquo;Otherwise?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Well, you&amp;rsquo;re quite lucky.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Lucky?&amp;rdquo; Kev was a little confused by William&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;ldquo;Your understanding of luck seems to be different from normal people?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William waved his hand, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s something I heard from other sellers of pirated study machines. They said a client, like you, had an accident and fell from the fifth floor in their virtual life. But the key is the man didn&amp;rsquo;t completely die, he became a vegetable, hanging by a thread and being taken care of by his family in the virtual world. He spent the rest of his ten years in the hospital. Just imagine, not being able to move at all and not knowing when you could die to come out…it&amp;rsquo;s even worse than death.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That sounds…indeed quite scary, so what happened to that person later?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William shook his head, &amp;ldquo;Who knows…our pirated ones don&amp;rsquo;t have a reality-virtuality isolation device. If it were a regular version, perhaps the client might suffer less.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That reminds me of a riddle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s hear it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do you know what in the world is longest and shortest, fastest and slowest, can be divided yet is vast, is the least valued yet is the most worthy of regret?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William thought for a while and replied, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William nodded pensively, &amp;ldquo;You are quite cultured.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just something I heard.&amp;rdquo; Kev explained, &amp;ldquo;I heard this from my son in the last virtual life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Alright.&amp;rdquo; William chuckled, &amp;ldquo;It seems deep learning does have some use.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;When can I start the second time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Not going to rest a bit?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; Kev stated. After experiencing the first pirated deep learning session, he felt that he had adapted to the virtual life mixed with real memories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;All the same, just pay.&amp;rdquo; William continued, rubbing his fingers together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev nodded, but when he opened his wallet, he realized he had only a little cash left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Could I use a card?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Brother, we are committing a crime here. Could you be a bit more serious?&amp;rdquo; William helplessly shook his head, pointed to the door, and said, &amp;ldquo;Turn left at the door, about five hundred meters away, there is an ATM.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev put his wallet away and said, &amp;ldquo;Then wait for me, I&amp;rsquo;ll be back soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William nodded, and then unlocked the layers of locks on the door, &amp;ldquo;I suggest you should withdraw more at once, looking at you, it seems like you&amp;rsquo;ll need it many times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev didn&amp;rsquo;t reply and just walked straight out the door, walked through the damp, abandoned factory, and made his way onto the main street of the industrial zone. Kev feels he&amp;rsquo;s not far from living a happy life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But withdrawing money in such a mixed-bag place like the industrial zone is undoubtedly a very dangerous behavior. Thinking about this made Kev nervous again. Luckily, the path to the ATM was quiet, with no one around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ten minutes later, Kev arrived at the ATM. The ATM&amp;rsquo;s one-from-one security system relaxed the originally tense Kev a little, but he still kept looking around as he withdrew money, fearing the desperados lurking in some dark corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Kev stashed the money away and double-checked again that there was no one around the ATM, he hugged his bag and quickly ran towards the abandoned factory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But just then, a homeless man appeared out of nowhere at the entrance of the abandoned factory, right where Kev was standing. The homeless man sat on the ground, covered in dirt and filth, his hair was long and covered in dust. By comparison, William looked merely shabby, but this homeless man was completely filthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev and the homeless man stared at each other for more than a minute. This stare-down felt like a cheetah and a gazelle on a prairie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next second, the homeless man stood up and walked toward Kev, but his actions were not in a storm-like manner to snatch things. He approached Kev in a trance, at a leisurely pace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev was startled by the homeless man&amp;rsquo;s actions, almost shouting out loud, but he eventually held out as being in such a place, shouting would only attract more predators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then the homeless man stopped when he was a few meters away from Kev, then pointed at the bag in Kev&amp;rsquo;s hand, and made a series of incomprehensible gestures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the homeless man wanted to express; he only knew that the other party must want money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is mine! You can&amp;rsquo;t take it!&amp;rdquo; Kev somehow found the courage to say this to the homeless man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The homeless man became a little frantic when he heard Kev&amp;rsquo;s words, his hand gestures also became more chaotic. He spoke a few words intermittently, &amp;ldquo;Go… you can&amp;rsquo;t… horrible… don&amp;rsquo;t…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The homeless man had lost his ability to speak, and at this moment, Kev was like a cornered dog, hugging his money and running towards the abandoned factory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev originally thought his actions were swift, but the moment he brushed past the homeless man, Kev&amp;rsquo;s arm was grabbed by the homeless man, and the bag fell to the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev wanted to pick up the bag, but the homeless man had a firm grip on him and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let go. He continued to speak incoherently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps out of fright, in the struggle, Kev kicked the homeless man in the stomach. The pain made the homeless man let go and fall to the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Realizing that the other party wasn&amp;rsquo;t that tough, Kev began punching and kicking at the homeless man. Once the homeless man couldn&amp;rsquo;t get up again, Kev finally picked up the bag that fell to the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you dare to rob again, I will kill you!&amp;rdquo; Kev said angrily to the man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man fell to the ground, one hand holding his stomach, and the other hand slightly raised, as if trying to grab Kev again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kev, seeing that there was nobody around, and considering that this was an industrial zone, where killing a person would hardly be noticed, kicked the homeless man in the face, finally, the man stopped moving.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing his coat dirtied by the homeless man, Kev didn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to take off his jacket and throw it to the side. He told himself that he would buy a more expensive coat after earning money from several more rounds of deep learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Returning to William&amp;rsquo;s place, Kev put the bag of money into William&amp;rsquo;s arms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Here is the money for thirty times.&amp;rdquo; Kev rolled up his sleeves and spoke, his spirit was entirely different from before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William, with the bag full of money in his arms, weighed it, and then casually tossed it onto the sofa without counting it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Thirty times? Are you sure?&amp;rdquo; Despite asking, William had already opened the plastic sheet and began configuring the learning machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Is there a problem?&amp;rdquo; Kev asked, and without waiting for a response, he lay down in the learning machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Of course, no problem. The customer is king. Especially the ones who&amp;rsquo;ve paid, we put your needs first.&amp;rdquo; William laughed as he placed the electrode sheets on Kev. &amp;ldquo;But let me make it clear since the users are different, I have no idea what will happen if you use it thirty times under these circumstances.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;d be at least bearable. It&amp;rsquo;s just like what happened to your client you mentioned, lying in the virtual life for perhaps over a dozen or even several dozen years…but that&amp;rsquo;d be better than this miserable and brutal reality life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So, we start now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirty lifetimes in a virtual world take about an hour and a half in the real world. Weighing up the time, William couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but marvel at the magic of this machine. Just by spending one and a half hours, the man who just entered the learning machine could gain about two thousand years of life experience, but that&amp;rsquo;s if everything goes well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Knock, knock, knock …&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A knock on the door interrupted William&amp;rsquo;s thoughts, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like opening it and instead quietly waited for a few seconds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Open the door! It&amp;rsquo;s me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hearing the person outside announce themselves, William walked slowly to open the iron door, only to see the tall thin man standing outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tall man walked into the room and immediately saw the learning machine in operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh! Is it already in use?&amp;rdquo; The tall man asked in surprise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William locked the iron door and walked to the sofa to pick up Kevin&amp;rsquo;s bag. He took out several bundles of money and handed it to the tall man, saying, &amp;ldquo;Here … this is what you deserve. You&amp;rsquo;ve outdone yourself this time. He wanted to use it thirty times right from the start.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tall man counted the money and laughed, saying, &amp;ldquo;Aren&amp;rsquo;t you afraid someone will die?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No one&amp;rsquo;s going to die, at most he may lose his soul, becoming yet another vagabond in this industrial zone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Our line of work has certainly increased the population of this industrial district.&amp;rdquo; The tall man sighed, &amp;ldquo;But on the other hand, if this guy goes mad after this, won&amp;rsquo;t I have to go find the next customer for you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that would be troublesome for you.&amp;rdquo; William spread his hands and laughed helplessly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;As long as there&amp;rsquo;s money to be made, a bit of trouble is nothing.&amp;rdquo; The tall man picked up the money and took a deep sniff, &amp;ldquo;Who could resist the smell of money?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two laughed heartily. The tall man left the room with his money after a few minutes, and William sat back on the sofa. He checked the time once more and mused to himself, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m really curious about what he&amp;rsquo;ll be like after he comes out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>……&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kevin could no longer remember how many times he had been born. He only remembered that he had had a few close shaves due to difficult births, but thankfully everything worked out fine each time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, having lived so many lifetimes, some of his memories had begun to blur. Whenever Kevin reached adulthood, his memories would intertwine with his previous virtual lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did he arrange to go out with friends? Does he have asthma? Does he have a younger brother? Did his parents divorce? Did he confess to his crush? What did he plan to do in this life?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He originally thought that thirty lifetimes would each be memorable, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that this false immortality, with only consciousness accumulating, would put such a great strain on memory storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to imagine that if he continues to live a virtual life in his current state, Kevin&amp;rsquo;s mind will certainly be thrown into chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only solution Kevin could think of now was to accelerate the progression of his virtual life by constantly dying and escaping the learning machine as soon as possible while he was still relatively sober.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But even though he knew he was living a virtual life, everything around him looked exactly like the real world, and the experience of the five senses was no different from reality. Accepting death a dozen times or so is too difficult; No one dares to die a dozen times, and Kevin&amp;rsquo;s consciousness is not very clear now. Reality and virtuality have lost their clear boundary in his mind. Every death to him feels almost like a real death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kevin stood on the rooftop, desperately trying to control his trembling legs. In Zhuangzi&amp;rsquo;s butterfly dream, was it Zhuangzi dreaming of becoming a butterfly, or was it a butterfly dreaming of becoming Zhuangzi? Just like Kevin now, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether entering the learning machine was a dream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After pondering for almost an hour, Kevin decided to give up thinking. He wandered towards the ground like a leaf losing its anchor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once, twice, three times…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fourth time he stood on the roof of a high-rise building, Kevin was trembling, and the psychological pain caused by only three deaths almost crushed his spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, Kevin left the roof in a daze.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the following lives, no matter how Kevin&amp;rsquo;s outward age changed, he acted like a zombie without want or need, or you could say that his consciousness had already turned into a stone. Whether it was being carved hollow by the wind and sand of suffering, or being worn into depressions by the river of life, Kevin was feeling nothing. Now in his life, he would only do one thing - to wait for death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>……&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An hour and a half later, William lit a cigarette, but until he finished, the learning machine showed no sign of being opened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Was the person dead inside?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thinking this, William walked over and tentatively opened the metal lid of the learning machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kevin was lying there with his eyes wide open, looking no different from being dead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>William lightly slapped Kevin&amp;rsquo;s face and Kevin slowly turned his face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Brother, are you okay?&amp;rdquo; William asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kevin didn&amp;rsquo;t answer, but just slowly sat up from the learning machine. The electrode sheets on his body fell off due to the pull.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m asking you something,&amp;rdquo; William asked again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Kevin still didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to hear, as he walked out of the learning machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It looks like he&amp;rsquo;s gone mad,&amp;rdquo; William muttered, rushing to unlock the iron door before Kevin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kevin left the room slowly, step by step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Take care, next time… never mind, there won&amp;rsquo;t be a next time.&amp;rdquo; William laughed as he closed the iron door, followed by a series of locking sounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now in the abandoned factory, there was only the dazed Kevin, who walked aimlessly towards the factory door. The vagabond who was killed by Kevin was still lying there. Of course, this memory was already gone from Kevin&amp;rsquo;s mind at this moment, but even if he could recall it, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t care…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, the huge industrial area has one more resident lost in their world…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several months later, another oddly dressed man found his way into the industrial district. He is holding a piece of paper, looking around nervously, obviously in search of something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon, the man stopped in front of an abandoned factory. After hesitating for a while, he finally stepped inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of this was witnessed by Kevin from a dark corner. He was covered in dirt, his hair was messy, and his eyes were void. There was a flicker of surprise in his eyes when he saw the man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An hour later, the man reappeared outside the factory. His expression had noticeably changed. He even wore a triumphant smile from time to time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man withdrew a large sum of money from an ATM not far from the factory, then ran back with a bag full of cash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kevin, feeling as though he was looking at his past self, was spirited for the first time in his dazed state. His chaotic thoughts had a clear purpose for the first time: to stop that man.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kevin pushed his skinny legs to run towards the man. Before the man could react, Kevin grabbed the big bag full of money and fell hard onto the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man was startled, but when he realized his money had been taken, he became angry, and he started to kick the fallen Kevin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A piece of scum dare to steal my money? I&amp;rsquo;ll kick you to death!&amp;rdquo; The man kicked Kevin while he was down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kevin clung tightly to the bag, using his body to pin it down, despite being unable to exert much strength.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t go… don&amp;rsquo;t go…&amp;rdquo; Kevin repeated these words over and over again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll kill you, you roach!&amp;rdquo; The man was too enraged to listen to anything. He thought Kevin was begging for mercy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Kevin was spitting out blood and was barely alive, the man snatched back the bag and spat on Kevin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Once I become a councilor, you garbage of society better be prepared to get cleared away.&amp;rdquo; The man said and directly walked into the factory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kevin was lying on the ground, motionless. He could feel his internal organs had been shattered by the kicks. He didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the strength left to feel the pain. Those eyes that had finally become spirited were now hollow again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s finally time to die… This life was horrible… The next one should be much better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Kevin now, the thing that was the longest yet the shortest, the fastest yet the slowest, the most divisible yet the most vast, the most negligible yet the most regrettable was not time, but life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With these thoughts in his mind, Kevin slowly closed his eyes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond Earth’s core</title><link>https://www.skstory.online/p/beyond-earths-core/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 17:04:16 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.skstory.online/p/beyond-earths-core/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*uaf7Mg2UclegdKD44FInNw.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Beyond Earth’s core" />&lt;p>A scientific accident has led us to discover the remains of a deity deep underground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We created a drill head made of a high-temperature-resistant alloy, dressed in a protective suit as heavy as a spacesuit, and drilled in a designated uninhabited area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After drilling two thousand meters deep, the exploration team leader found magma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inside the magma was enveloped a segment of stark white bone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was this that had destroyed the cutting machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This place originally was China&amp;rsquo;s Jinping Underground Laboratory, located two thousand four hundred meters underground, it&amp;rsquo;s the deepest laboratory in the world that is used for dark matter research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean sat inside the isolation room, wordless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through the one-way glass, I could observe him focusing his gaze on the door.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What are you looking at?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean, like a wind-up machine, his eyes wide open, rigidly turned his neck: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the cross.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The cross?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I lowered my head to look at the surveillance footage, light was shining through the gap in the isolation room door, forming a long cross shadow on the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Does it hold any special meaning?&amp;rdquo; I asked again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know… I advise you to run away as quickly as you can. Escape from here, from this abyss back to the surface…
It&amp;rsquo;s not too late yet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Sean,&amp;rdquo; I sighed and said, &amp;ldquo;I just parachuted in, everything is all dark in front of me, I need to know what happened here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean wanted to smoke, but I rejected him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A formerly cheerful and optimistic colleague who had suddenly turned into a living corpse, anyone would find unsettling. Sean lowered his head, hoarsely and slowly telling me his account of events…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an accidental collision experiment in 2011, we found a single photon existing, entangled with another photon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The strange thing is, that we could not find the other photon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, the long-range action of the other photon reacted with the photon we were observing - it changed from a particle to a wave right under our eyelids.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make an inappropriate analogy: Wave-particle duality is like two blind boxes, inside which could be different or identical things. As long as we open one of them, the thing in the other blind box must invariably become the same as the former.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the long-range action of quantum physics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the situation we encountered at that time was more like we only saw one blind box, the other one was gone - the ball inside the blind box we saw suddenly changed into a square right under our eyelids, and without any external force influencing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is to say, another observer emerged from the other blind box, and the physics of this world took it as the norm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In its perspective, the thing inside the blind box is a square, so the other blind box - the photon we observed - also became a square.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is no longer just a matter of modern physics being unstable, more importantly, unknown intelligent lives exist on Earth, but we do not know where they are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;At the time, that project was under my responsibility,&amp;rdquo; Sean said, &amp;ldquo;At the request of the state, I classified this discovery as a top secret. Since then, the state began to devote a lot of manpower and resources to seek the other &amp;lsquo;photon&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Did you find it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No, but we found the direction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Where?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Underground.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2012, Sean led the research group to find the rough direction of the other photon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was right underneath the Jinping Underground Laboratory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a project far larger than the Kola Superdeep Borehole was launched stealthily. They hollowed out the entire mountain above the Jinping Underground Laboratory, leaving only a thin layer of ground. Then, they dismantled the Jinping Underground Laboratory and started digging downward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For each one thousand meters down, they had to expand the passage, build elevators, build buildings laterally, and build new laboratories; after confirming in the lab that the &amp;ldquo;photon&amp;rdquo; was still below, they would continue to dig down.
This project was a bottomless pit, constantly guzzling massive amounts of funding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 2031, that is this year, this inverted triangle building had extended to thirty-five kilometers underground, nearing the bottom of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was just when they were about to puncture through the crust and enter the mantle that an accident happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In previous experiments, there was always a strange &amp;lsquo;single photon&amp;rsquo; in an observation group. We may be maintaining a synchronic tacit agreement with another observer,&amp;rdquo; Sean paused and took a deep breath before continuing, &amp;ldquo;This means that, just like us, they have been always observing the photon - while we&amp;rsquo;re looking for them, they are also approaching us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do you mean there are intelligent lifeforms underground?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; Sean shook his head, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the word &amp;rsquo;lifeform&amp;rsquo; applies to them - even tardigrades can only tolerate temperatures up to 150 degrees, but where we are, the temperature is as high as 967 degrees Celsius. Just stepping out of this building, we would be instantly roasted into a mummy - I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what kind of life could survive in such severe conditions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean&amp;rsquo;s words were too far-fetched, which made me start to consider other possibilities: &amp;ldquo;Could there be some special physical phenomena that haven&amp;rsquo;t been discovered yet?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There could have been, originally,&amp;rdquo; Sean&amp;rsquo;s face gradually distorted, he said with a laugh that was also like crying, &amp;ldquo;But not anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>6&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In theory, the mantle is solid, but just to be safe, the geologists of the research group were well-prepared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They produced super high-temperature-resistant alloy drill heads, wore protective suits as heavy as spacesuits, and performed drilling in designated uninhabited areas. This was to collect samples to learn about the condition of the mantle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After drilling two thousand meters deep, the exploration team leader David noticed something odd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The data stopped changing, and the temperature of the drill head no longer rose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In theory, the drill head should&amp;rsquo;ve punctured the lithosphere and entered the mantle, where the temperature would keep rising. Because the mantle is likely a fluid, the drill head being burned was within expectation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the strange thing was, the drill head was working normally, and the detected temperature remained constant at one thousand degrees Celsius.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though it kept going down, the data didn&amp;rsquo;t change at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David suspected the detector was damaged and decided to retrieve the drill head immediately. After an inspection, there was nothing wrong with the data, and the drill head had collected samples of the mantle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fluid magma had burned the inner tank of the drill head, so David had no choice but to forcibly dismantle it. They used a cutter to separate the inner tank and the solidified magma, then started to cut the magma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this process, the cutter was broken by a hard object.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A piece of stark white bone was encased in the magma, and it was that which broke the cutter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>7&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We tried all means but couldn&amp;rsquo;t even separate a single molecule from that bone,&amp;rdquo; said Sean, with trembling hands,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That thing, merely by existing, has completely overturned the existing biology and physics.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Just a bone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No, more than one. During the subsequent collection process, we gradually completed the skeletal artifact. Then we increased the intensity of mining. You should know that mining at nearly a thousand degrees under the ground is as difficult as establishing a colony on Mars - but we succeeded and officially entered the mantle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Then what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean&amp;rsquo;s mood became very low, &amp;ldquo;According to the staff&amp;rsquo;s statements, the reconstructed biological skeleton is inexplicably strange. I saw the pictures, but it&amp;rsquo;s very hard for me to describe what it looks like. It&amp;rsquo;s like… like a monkey with wings… a snake with osteophytes full of spikes… an octopus with three heads… it&amp;rsquo;s simply God&amp;rsquo;s leftover work, the source of all chaos and distortion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought for a while and asked: &amp;ldquo;Is this the intelligent life we are looking for?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No, it&amp;rsquo;s not, they are still within the scope of human observation. What we are looking for might be &amp;lsquo;God&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;God?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;After completing the phase three predictions and unmanned construction, we created a &amp;lsquo;Mantle Submarine&amp;rsquo;, named&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Deeper&amp;rsquo;. You can think of it as a manned big drill with its nuclear power. David drove it personally, deep into the mantle. When he came back, he said he saw God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I leaned forward: &amp;ldquo;What kind of God?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The Jade Emperor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How is it certain to be it?&amp;rdquo; I asked in confusion, &amp;ldquo;No one has ever seen what a God looks like, how could David be
sure that what he saw was the so-called Jade Emperor?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know. In the subsequent, eight people took turns driving the Deeper into the mantle, each claimed to have seen a deity… there were well-known ones like God, Buddha, Jesus, and Odin, and there were also newly created evil gods like Cthulhu and Azathoth. Three days later, the base at the lowest level lost contact. Severe electromagnetic interference caused all probe machines to malfunction. I was not on the bottom floor at the time, I could only command remotely. But all I got from the radio were spooky and indistinct murmurings, plus sharp and piercing screams.&amp;rdquo;
Sean ceased the narration: &amp;ldquo;As you see, we confirmed that there are unknown and incomprehensible things inside the Earth, and then unknown factors caused the destruction of the research base at the lowest level.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Did they all die?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>8&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to go to the lowest level to see what exactly happened there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean argued against it. There was a horizontal structure for every thousand meters in this building, and each
structure had a person in charge. If he didn&amp;rsquo;t cooperate, no one would have the authority to enter the lowest level.
He called for me to isolate the second-to-last level immediately. Anyone who escaped from the bottom level needed to
be quarantined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know anything yet,&amp;rdquo; Sean said leaning into the one-way glass, his face ferocious, &amp;ldquo;You can escape now. Once you go in, it is an irretrievable abyss. Even to the farthest corner of the earth, they can catch up with you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I raised my eyebrows and asked in return: &amp;ldquo;Are you hiding something from me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I cannot say! You cannot know! It&amp;rsquo;s a meme contagion, you will be affected by them as soon as you hear or even know them, understand?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak for a while, then I decided: &amp;ldquo;If gods are living in the dark underground, then they are not some beings with supreme power and glory; if they are part of the world&amp;rsquo;s rules, then science will tame them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean fell into silence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I reported the situation upwards, the upper management approved my request, revoked Sean&amp;rsquo;s authority, and temporarily granted me a top-level authority ID card.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A ten-person special squad was temporarily conscripted. They escorted Sean and entered the elevator with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After I inserted the ID card and entered the password, a thirty-second countdown started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The elevator has dozens of seats, everyone sat down and buckled their seat belts. After the countdown ended, a strong sense of weightlessness came, making people feel dizzy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We are plummeting into hell,&amp;rdquo; Sean said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>9&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The person in charge has the right to seal off a certain area in case of emergency, all staff had already signed a confidentiality agreement before they came down, and they would be awarded the medal of heroism posthumously by the State.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, if there is some force majeure happening at the bottom level, the stationed personnel there are probably all sacrificed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because Sean immediately sealed off the bottom level, he didn&amp;rsquo;t even leave time for evacuation. Probably over two hundred people were locked inside, only a handful managed to escape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fifteen minutes later, we arrived at the bottom level and changed into protective suits in the isolation room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The big door slowly opened, and the emergency backup light in the corridor was extremely dim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They were almost out of power, and this place would fall into darkness soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Did you shut off the life support system?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean shook his head: &amp;ldquo;No, the first system to fail was the lighting system. All we could see on the monitor was lights going off one by one. In the dark, all communication equipment malfunctioned.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What about wired telephones, are they also not usable?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You probably don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand, let me demonstrate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean took a tactical flashlight from a soldier, he walked to a dark corner that the backup light couldn&amp;rsquo;t reach with the flashlight on - it was a triangle corner, Sean leaned against the wall and turned off the flashlight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He was swallowed by darkness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We stood waiting for a few minutes, not seeing Sean take the next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I asked with confusion: &amp;ldquo;Sean? Weren&amp;rsquo;t you going to demonstrate?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Silence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No one answered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I turned on my flashlight and shone it towards that corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was no one there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>10&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The walls are sturdy, made of a special alloy, without any cracks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Emergency lighting illuminates both walls, leaving only a dead zone in the middle untouched by the light beam, just big enough for an adult to stand in. As long as you step out from the corner of the room, you will be caught by the
emergency light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under these circumstances, Sean simply vanished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fear, like a slippery snake, coils around my heart. I realize that Sean probably lied to me. He must have been one of the observers, present at the time of the incident. He understood the severity of the situation, escaped, and chose to seal this place as a priority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To figure out what was going on, I had two soldiers holding a nylon rope, one of them shut off the flashlight and walked into the dark corner just like Sean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rope was suspended in mid-air. When we started calling out to the soldiers, there was no response.
Another soldier tried to pull him out of the darkness, but even with the help of four or five people, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t pull the rope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had no other choice but to turn on the flashlight and shine it towards that dark corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only to see the other end of the rope embedded in the alloy wall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I swallowed a lump in my throat, the absurd scene before me temporarily halted my thought process. The place we were
in seemed unreal - a place where all known logic from the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface became void.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next moment, the emergency lighting battery ran out and shut off simultaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flashlight began to malfunction and flickered for a moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Darkness fell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the light came back on, our path back had disappeared. All around were strange machinery and equipment, likely inside some laboratory at the bottom level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, we found that in the short blink of darkness, three veteran special forces soldiers had disappeared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quietly, unexpectedly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>11&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon, I roughly figured out the pattern of &amp;ldquo;human evaporation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As long as you are in the dark, you will be randomly transported to any place untouched by light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ever since I entered this place, the flashlight had been flickering unstably, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a stable light source to ensure I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be randomly transported. Therefore, I experienced eight rounds of darkness, each time the flashlight came back on, I saw a strange environment, and I was separated from the soldiers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this process, I saw half a corpse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Half of it was embedded in the wall, and half was exposed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This proves that the transport does not avoid obstacles, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible that the next time I fall into darkness, I could be transported into a load-bearing pillar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t understand the principle behind these phenomena, nor do I understand how these bizarre things are possible. It is this unknown that makes me more fearful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean was right. If this situation spreads to the upper buildings, the best action would be to escape as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>12&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The building complex has turned into a giant maze.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every time I was about to find an exit, the darkness would come as expected, taking me to a place even more strange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I saw a skeleton tens of meters high, covered with bone spikes, grotesque and terrifying, it&amp;rsquo;s unimaginable how shocking it was when it was alive;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I saw bodies &amp;ldquo;embedded&amp;rdquo; in the walls, the scariest being a ceiling with dozens of arms sticking out. It was probably a large-scale transport that sent several people into the wall at once;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I saw security doors twisted out of shape from impact, a hallway filled with dried blood and battle scars… Until the thirty-second move, I came to a familiar place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind the door, at the glow of the crucifix.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Single-sided glass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isolation room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the second last floor, my being able to be transported here meant the seal had failed, and that the special
situation was spreading upwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this moment, Sean&amp;rsquo;s warning echoed in my mind:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Even to the ends of the earth, they can catch up with you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The light abruptly went out, and endless screams and howls came from all around. My eardrums were about to burst, my thoughts scattered, and my senses of the world became abstract and meshed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I frantically scrambled in the dark, slapping the flashlight hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, I tripped over something, banging my head hard on something solid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I lost consciousness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>13&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It hurts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels as if a steel needle has been jabbed into my head, causing unbearable pain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My face also hurts, a burning kind of pain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vaguely, I heard a blurred shout:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Are you still conscious?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Someone was slapping my face hard. My consciousness gradually returned, but my brain was somewhat groggy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It hurts…stop hitting…&amp;rdquo; I muttered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It works!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The person exclaimed delightedly, then continued to slap my face like a storm. I almost passed out from his slaps, so
I had to use all my strength to raise my hand and cover my head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hang in there! Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by the evil god!&amp;rdquo; the person shouted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m fine! Stop fu*king hitting me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sobered up and opened my eyes. The light around was dim, and a kerosene lamp was placed on the ground. My body armor had been taken off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man who was beating me was a man dressed like an Arab, wrapped tightly in a white bedsheet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this?&amp;rdquo; The man held up his middle finger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is an internationally recognized gesture. Stop taking advantage of me, &amp;quot; I sat up, somewhat dazed, &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where am I?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man lifted the sheet covering his head to reveal a bearded face: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s me, David!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recognized him. He was David, the head of the exploration project, a well-known geologist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to Sean&amp;rsquo;s statement, I remembered that he was the first one to pilot the submersible into the mantle. I had subconsciously thought he was the first to die, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect him to still be alive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Judging by the furnishings around us, we were in a small storage room. A simple hammock hung on the shelves, and the corner was filled with domestic garbage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David had been living here for a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s going on upstairs?&amp;rdquo; David grasped my collar, &amp;ldquo;Why is the elevator sealed? Last week, I finally managed to enter the elevator, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start after entering the password.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was somewhat surprised: &amp;ldquo;Last week? I received the news yesterday and entered this afternoon, it&amp;rsquo;s only been two days… What&amp;rsquo;s this about last week?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under the dim side light, I noticed David&amp;rsquo;s expression was extremely pained.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He counter-asked: &amp;ldquo;How many times have you experienced darkness?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You mean being in a lightless environment? Seems like… thirty-three times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;You can still be alive, you can still maintain your sanity!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Every time you&amp;rsquo;re in darkness, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t die on the spot or lose your mind, it means there&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;positive god&amp;rsquo; protecting you… but this protection is limited, it can only transport you to a safe &amp;rsquo;time-space point&amp;rsquo; in the darkness, letting those lurking &amp;rsquo;evil gods&amp;rsquo; temporarily lose sight of you. But once you&amp;rsquo;re in darkness for too long, you&amp;rsquo;ll be caught by the &amp;rsquo;evil gods.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remained silent for a while, then went on to ask, &amp;ldquo;How do you know all this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David suddenly tore off the cloth hanging on the shelf, revealing a wall full of scratch marks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using one horizontal and three vertical lines as a unit of measurement, there were over a hundred marks, almost covering the majority of the wall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Each scratch represents one day. Measure it by a week,&amp;rdquo; David said morosely, &amp;ldquo;I have been trapped underground for two years. What I know is all the experience other survivors paid with their lives to figure out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>14&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to David, there might exist a four-dimensional space with energy-momentum inside the mantle… It could also be a five-dimensional or even higher-dimensional space, but with his cognitive ability, he was only able to understand a portion of the fourth dimension through the instruments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this multi-dimensional space, there is life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They can observe the quantum changes in the micro world, thereby sensing the existence of humans. This is the original reason behind the bizarre photon changes - they are intentionally luring humans down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We dug into the mantle and overlapped with the fourth-dimensional space. It&amp;rsquo;s not a stable space, and it will continue to expand, just like the singularity of the universe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David drew a line on a piece of paper, explaining, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re the three-dimensional beings intruding into the four-dimensional space, like a worm crawling on top of a piece of paper, it won&amp;rsquo;t undergo any changes. But if you draw
a line in front of it, it will perceive it as an obstacle - in terms of time and space perception, higher-dimensional beings have an absolute advantage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David crumpled the paper and handed it to me, &amp;ldquo;In our perception, time is linear. This line represents the journey of a three-dimensional being, on a crumpled plane, the line will distort, overlap, and even merge. I can crumple it randomly, or I can deliberately overlap it, just like drawing a circle for the worm.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In other words, every time darkness falls, what I face is not only the space changes but also the changes in the timeline?&amp;rdquo; I quickly realized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right, they manipulate our position in time and space as if drawing a line in front of a worm is effortless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I asked again: &amp;ldquo;What about these &amp;rsquo;evil gods&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;positive gods&amp;rsquo;? What exactly did you see in the mantle - in this fourth-dimensional space?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t ask, the less you know the better,&amp;rdquo; David held up three fingers: &amp;ldquo;There are three things we can never do in
here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;First, never pray to any god.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Second, never stay in the dark.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Third, never stare at any living creatures that are out of cognitive range.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>15&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most reliable source of light is fire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;As long as there&amp;rsquo;s sufficient oxygen and fuel, it will keep burning,&amp;rdquo; David handed me a kerosene lamp, &amp;ldquo;For safety reasons, we should each have one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ID card was still in my hand, even if the underground building was completely closed, we could take the elevator to any floor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David suggested that I wrap myself in a white bedsheet, saying it was beneficial for concealment. I followed his advice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like the phantoms of ghost stories, we each held a kerosene lamp, groping our way in the dark, narrow corridor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;They can sense our existence,&amp;rdquo; David said, &amp;ldquo;But because of the light, the evil gods can&amp;rsquo;t see us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It sounds safe,&amp;rdquo; I nodded, &amp;ldquo;As long as we maintain this status, we can find the elevator.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No, this exactly means that the real horror is coming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If a sugar cube is mixed with grit, how would you get it out?&amp;rdquo; David paused, then continued, &amp;ldquo;Simple, just scatter a
bunch of ants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Ants?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Have you seen those bone spurs that were dug out of the mantle?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remembering those ghastly skeletons, I nodded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re alive, they&amp;rsquo;re the ants that prey on us - there are many, many such creatures in here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>16&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David spread out a hand-drawn map, detailing every room and every passage in the lowest level, marking dangerous places with a red cross.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every time we passed a corner or bypassed a branch road, David would explain to me in a low voice the reason for doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Elevators with separate isolation rooms have been completely blocked, so our destination for this trip is the backup elevator, which is still operational.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There are huge red tumors here, sticking to the ceiling, extending tentacles to prey on all creatures passing under it… This is where Xia Ning died.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a stitched-up creature haunting this place, it sprays a kind of fungus that devours human brains, then attaches human limbs to its body… Old Li, Ah Cheng, and Zhang Mo, three people died here at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a human-faced spider on the left turn, its body is like liquid metal, it can stretch and squeeze at will, it almost has no hearing, it preys by spider web… Jennick sacrificed himself here to defend our retreat…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Wang Zi was alive just last month… You should have seen him, the skinny one who always bragged about his daughter. He swallowed zinc hydride while I was asleep and committed suicide.&amp;rdquo;
David&amp;rsquo;s voice choked up a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remembered Jennick was his brother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When disaster struck, the survivors clung together for survival, struggling. Now, only David remained alive. There was no way forward, no way back; no sunlight up above, and it was hard to descend to the underworld.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What a terrible loneliness and desperation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just being alive took a lot of courage and determination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>17&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I think I hear someone calling my name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Is it a hallucination?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I listen carefully and frown, &amp;ldquo;No, it&amp;rsquo;s real. You didn&amp;rsquo;t hear it? It&amp;rsquo;s Shaun&amp;rsquo;s voice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Shaun?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;But hasn&amp;rsquo;t he been dead for a long time?&amp;rdquo; David wondered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as I was about to ask in detail, I saw David&amp;rsquo;s face suddenly change drastically. He raised his index finger to his mouth, signaling me to be quiet. Then he put his ear against the wall and listened carefully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Four or five seconds later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Run!!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David suddenly shouted and started running.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next moment, the entire passage began to vibrate, dust fell from the ceiling, and the walls made a sharp metallic
sound.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kerosene lamp swung with our movement, its light flickering. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s happening?!&amp;rdquo; I yelled as I ran.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The &amp;lsquo;flood&amp;rsquo; is coming!&amp;rdquo; David called back, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t look back no matter what!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t look back?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon I heard the sound of water coming from behind, like some sticky liquid rushing through the pipes. Amidst numerous noises, I heard many people calling my name from behind. Some of the voices are young, some are old, and all of them are people I know, and even included my long-deceased mother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s an elevator on the left! Hold on, don&amp;rsquo;t look back!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>High-intensity running made my chest rise and fall violently. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t experienced a 1500-meter run since college - lack of exercise made my lung capacity struggle to keep up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The gap between David and me widened, and a sense of despair washed over me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the left turn, I saw David had run to the elevator door first, pressing the open button anxiously waiting. Since he couldn&amp;rsquo;t turn back, he had to shout at me back: &amp;ldquo;Run! This is the only way!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I got into the elevator, David closed the metal door. I collapsed to my knees in front of the chair, gasping heavily, feeling as if my heart would jump out of my throat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sound of the door closing continued, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but turn around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- - In that instant, I understood why David warned me not to look back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the dark corridor, countless black serpents with a single gigantic eye were coiling together, their pupils
refracting a crimson light. Just a glance froze me, making it difficult for me to move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was as if I had eaten a poisonous mushroom and was seeing distorted images.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not until the elevator door closed and blocked my view did this strange state end. An intense vertigo made me feel
sick, and I was vomiting constantly on the floor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boom-Boom-&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The elevator door was hit by a group of snakes, and the metal door was distorted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This door won&amp;rsquo;t hold!&amp;rdquo; David said urgently. &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s the ID card? Hurry, start the elevator!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Struggling with vertigo, I reached into my pocket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having heard Shaun&amp;rsquo;s voice outside the door, I froze: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t give it to him! He&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;believer&amp;rsquo; too, he wants to escape from here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David yelled angrily: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to those ghost things! All I do is to save you and myself!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From his gaze, I could feel the resolve and courage, but I became silent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What are you hesitating about?!&amp;rdquo; David urged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I said, &amp;ldquo;As long as you can answer one question, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you the ID card.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Ask it quickly!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Although the design of the underground building was supposed to be a semi-permanent facility, that could last for more than fifty years. But last year we updated the oxygen system, the lowest level hasn&amp;rsquo;t caught up… so the oxygen here can only last a year and a half,&amp;rdquo; I looked at him and said in a low voice, &amp;ldquo;How did you survive for two years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David was stunned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, the kerosene lamp in his hand went out without a breeze.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>18&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is simple, if David had experienced darkness within a year and a half, then he could have been transported to a year earlier - because the space-time here was chaotic, theoretically, he could survive for two years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, when the kerosene lamp in his hand extinguished, his body shriveled up, and became skeletal, and his face was frighteningly ferocious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David has been dead for a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s a believer of the Positive God. As long as the kerosene lamp is lit, he can maintain his sanity and physical body,&amp;rdquo; Shaun&amp;rsquo;s voice from outside the door was hoarse, &amp;ldquo;Do you see it now? The Positive God and the Evil God are essentially the same.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like lightning piercing through the clouds, Shaun&amp;rsquo;s words made those minor details line up. I glimpsed part of the truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- - The high-dimensional intelligent entity broadens its dimension through observing and using light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming there are two kinds of intelligent entities in this dimension, the Positive God and the Evil God. The former can control the &amp;ldquo;three-dimensional space of the lighted area&amp;rdquo;, and the latter can &amp;ldquo;do whatever they want in the dark&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Earth was originally a place where day and night alternated, and the powers of the two should be balanced. But this place is underground, a place where the sun can&amp;rsquo;t reach. Therefore, the power of the Evil God expanded infinitely, overpowering the Positive God.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They both have an urgent common goal, which is to reach the surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this, they are willing to cooperate: The Positive God uses its ability to control light to maintain observation of photons, which makes the scientists in the Jinping Underground Laboratory discover anomalies and attract humans to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then the Evil God broadens the dimension, turns the bottom layer into a place without light, and starts to slaughter and contaminate humans. Just like the fungus that controls ants, it often controls the ant body to return to the ant nest, and then slowly breeds in the entire ant nest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shaun is an ant controlled by the Evil God, carrying some kind of &amp;ldquo;pathogen&amp;rdquo; that I can&amp;rsquo;t understand, and the second-to-last layer collapsed because of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As long as humans pray, they can take them as believers. Becoming a believer will inevitably contaminate the spirit - this is also the reason why David warned me not to pray to the gods in his sane state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They maintain a competitive relationship in their cooperation, and obviously, neither of them has made it out so far.
Both the Positive God and the Evil God wanted to be the first to reach the surface, for which they were willing to trip each other up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the kerosene lamp in David&amp;rsquo;s hand went out, his body began to shrink, becoming skeletal and distorted, just like a monster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this moment, David howled and rushed at me, but I kicked him away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I stepped up to the elevator control panel and pressed the emergency stop button, and the elevator door slowly closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took the kerosene lamp and went to the top of the elevator, opened the maintenance hole above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David tried to climb up, but in the next second, the metal door was knocked open, and countless crazed black snakes flooded into the elevator. I closed the maintenance hole and locked it from the outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I climbed out of the elevator shaft and arrived at the second-to-last floor, shaking off those monsters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kerosene lamp fuel was limited, I had three hours of safety period left. The time was not enough for me to climb up along the elevator shaft - just the one-kilometer distance between the bottom layer and the second-to-last layer almost exhausted me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding some supplies and waiting for rescue was the safest option. But after what happened to David, I changed my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to take a risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>19&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To facilitate the transportation of heavy objects like &amp;ldquo;Deep Diver&amp;rdquo;, a universal track has been set up in the spare elevator. Fortunately, the main maintenance is done on the second-to-last floor, allowing me to implement my plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I operate the control panel, change the slide track for the Deep Diver, and install it in the elevator shaft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After preparation, I put on the protective suit and continued to climb up along the elevator shaft, ready to enter the
Deep Diver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly, the sound of Sean echoes in the hollow elevator shaft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think the Deep Diver can break through the 33-story alloy blockade,&amp;rdquo; he stands in the emergency passage of the elevator shaft, his body is immersed in darkness, and I can only vaguely see a humanoid outline, &amp;ldquo;Relax, I also wish you can escape - I said this before you came down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remained silent for a while and replied, &amp;ldquo;Is it because I have also been mentally contaminated?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;…… Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;From the moment I saw that cross made of light, right?&amp;rdquo; I hesitated, sitting on the edge of the Deep Diver cabin,
&amp;ldquo;The moment you escaped, they radiated their power to the second to last floor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Right, you were supposed to return to the surface with the favor of the true God. But you did not report back,
instead, you came down to investigate, disrupting our plans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a believer in the True God too?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No, I am in darkness, a follower of the Evil God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sean walked into where the kerosene lamp could shine, and leisurely said, &amp;ldquo;The explosives originally used to blast open the rock formations and the nuclear batteries in the experimental stage have all been concentrated here by you.
You simply want to gamble a little bit. The great kinetic energy and the narrow pipe effect will drive the Deep Diver to move at high speed upward and break through the blockade forcibly, just like a bullet being shot out of the gun barrel, and you can escape from the underground through this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I neither agreed nor disagreed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no need to take risks, join us. Look at me now. I&amp;rsquo;m healthy. I have powers that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even imagine in
the past, and I can even live forever - &amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the cost?&amp;rdquo; I interrupted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There is no cost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No, there must be one. You&amp;rsquo;ve given up the dignity of being a human being, a group of humans, you&amp;rsquo;ve betrayed your country and your faith. We&amp;rsquo;ve spent thousands of years getting rid of feudalism and ignorance, and through the efforts of countless generations, we&amp;rsquo;ve built a beautiful country - I won&amp;rsquo;t allow anything to destroy it, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a deity, it has to submit to the glory of science and reason.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the use of saying all this?&amp;rdquo; Sean said mockingly, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re just a man afraid of death, as long as you escape, they&amp;rsquo;ll come to the surface, I don&amp;rsquo;t even need to stop you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I smiled, picked up the kerosene lamp, and sat in the Deep Diver cabin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AI started a countdown:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Detonation countdown has begun: 10, 9, 8, 7……&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot; Wish me luck.&amp;rdquo; I fastened myself with the seat belt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through the porthole, I gave Sean the thumbs up. His face suddenly turned very bad, as if he realized what I was about to do. He started to scream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Black snakes like a flood surged into the elevator and smacked at the Deep Diver, but it was already too late.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;……2, 1, 0……Detonation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The countdown had ended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fission of atoms unleashed terrifying light and heat that illuminated several underground buildings. The radiation and energy destroyed countless creatures hidden in the dark. The black snakes were burned to white bones. The Deep
Diver did not shoot upwards, instead like a bullet, it drilled into the mantle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, this is my plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to go down to see the real faces of these &amp;ldquo;Gods&amp;rdquo;, and then invite them to eat a nuclear bomb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>20&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a second nuclear explosion in the mantle layer, the Deep Diver was also near its limit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nearly 10G acceleration caused me unbearable pain. The enormous potential energy pressed me hard against the backrest, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even breathe, it felt like my body was about to be torn apart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My eyes began to fill with blood and the world turned red.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it took, but the Deep Diver&amp;rsquo;s speed slowed down to a level that I could bear. During this process, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any so-called gods, nor did I see any demons or evil spirits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outside the porthole, the red magma gradually turned into a hard rock formation. The Deep Diver automatically activated built-in kinetic energy and drilled straight ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The instrument showed that the external temperature was decreasing, and I had a hunch in my heart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the area beneath the mantle layer is a spherical high-dimensional space, according to relativity, it should not be a conventional sphere or singularity - which means that the interior of the high-dimensional space might be hollow, like the sandwich layer between two universes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have thought that the universe is vast and infinite, constantly expanding outward. But actually, we might be inside the universe, and beneath the Earth is the outside of the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>High-dimensional space is the &amp;ldquo;connecting point&amp;rdquo; that makes &amp;ldquo;two&amp;rdquo; universes curved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crossing through high-dimensional space, you can reach another planet similar to Earth, another crust layer, which can be verified from David&amp;rsquo;s drilling anomaly, he found that the heating no longer increased if you drill down, which
indicates that it might be another crust rather than the highly heated core below the mantle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What awaits me could be another parallel world or an unheard extraterrestrial civilization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Deep Diver, having withstood two nuclear explosions and conducted nearly 20 kilometers of drilling, ended its
magnificent and tough life the moment it drilled out of the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kerosene lamp had long gone out, I left the cabin of the Deep Diver, but it was pitch black all around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up drilling into the Earth&amp;rsquo;s core and being burned to ashes due to high temperatures, that proves
that my guess is not wrong. What awaits me now is the unknown. This is a new world that humans know nothing about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first light of dawn pierced the darkness. I stood on the wreckage of the machinery in my protective suit, gazing into the distance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The night breeze was blowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> - I saw stars, the ocean, and a cross reaching heaven and earth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Has technology advanced too fast in the past century?</title><link>https://www.skstory.online/p/has-technology-advanced-too-fast-in-the-past-century/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 22:55:07 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.skstory.online/p/has-technology-advanced-too-fast-in-the-past-century/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*bCXxi7RBDZ6YvK0wN74oXA.png" alt="Featured image of post Has technology advanced too fast in the past century?" />&lt;p>Scientists would never imagine being drowned in the ocean of knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;lsquo;Deity&amp;rsquo; suddenly appears, happily answering every question posed by mankind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until the last question humans posed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They asked the &amp;lsquo;Deity&amp;rsquo;, &amp;ldquo;How can we become like you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Teacher!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the quiet exam room, I suddenly raised my hand to call the invigilator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong? Is there a problem with the question?&amp;rdquo; The invigilator came to my side after hearing my request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s an answer sheet in my drawer.&amp;rdquo; I looked at her with the sincerest expression I could manage, a mix of obedience and grievance in my eyes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This…&amp;rdquo; The invigilator, seemingly encountering such a situation for the first time, looked urgently at the other invigilator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quickly, I became the focal point of the examination hall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To prevent disturbing the other students, an invigilator took me out of the examination hall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Is this answer sheet yours?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It isn&amp;rsquo;t mine. It inexplicably appeared in my drawer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If the thing is not yours, how did it end up in your drawer? Didn&amp;rsquo;t we say before the exam to check the drawers?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I checked it! This thing just appeared out of thin air. If it was mine, why would I raise my hand and let you guys know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The invigilator was at a loss for words for a moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that moment, the head of the invigilation team passed by and saw me talking to the invigilator outside the examination hall, so he came over and asked, &amp;lsquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong? Is there anything this candidate needs?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Team Lead, you came at the right time. This student said he found an answer sheet in his drawer.&amp;rsquo; The invigilator handed the answer sheet to the team lead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The leader frowned, took a careful look at the answer, and his frown deepened, even becoming a bit flustered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Where did you get this?&amp;rdquo; The leader asked me severely, pointing at the answer sheet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing him so furious, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t indulge him and stood upright, righteously denying, &amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not mine, it appeared out of nowhere, if you don&amp;rsquo;t believe it, you can check the surveillance.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Check it! We must check!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The invigilator and I were frightened by the leader&amp;rsquo;s voice, which echoed throughout the entire teaching building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The invigilator quickly pulled the group leader aside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though they did their best to keep their voices down, I could still hear them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Team Lead, isn&amp;rsquo;t this going too far?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Going too far? Take a close look at this answer sheet. This is the correct answer to the exam!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t be? Is this considered a leak of the exam?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m telling you, we have to take this matter seriously. Today is the last day of the college entrance examination, we can&amp;rsquo;t allow any mishap. If we don&amp;rsquo;t handle it well, we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do this job anymore.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then the two brought me to the surveillance room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reviewing the surveillance footage over and over again, the two finally believed my words. The answer did indeed appear in my drawer out of nowhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Team Lead, what should we do now?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;What should we do? I&amp;rsquo;ve been invigilating for over 20 years and I&amp;rsquo;ve never encountered such a situation.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Should we… call the police?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Call the police? Are you crazy?&amp;rsquo; The leader glared at the invigilator and then told me, &amp;lsquo;You go back to the exam first.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I gave the leader a blank look, he wasted my time, what else could I accomplish if I went back?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to cause more trouble, so I followed the invigilator back to the exam room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had just sat down and was about to pick up my pen to write, and I noticed a piece of white paper poking out of my drawer. I pulled it out and it&amp;rsquo;s another answer sheet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I raised my hand again. The invigilator, who probably guessed what had happened, hurried over. Seeing another answer sheet appearing in my drawer, he almost fell over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He looked at me, his eyes full of the expression &amp;lsquo;How come there&amp;rsquo;s another one?&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shook my head, indicating that I knew nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The invigilator crumpled up the answer sheet and gestured for me to continue the exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I nodded, about to continue writing, but once again I saw a paper filled with answers in my drawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the bell rang, the broadcast announced that candidates should put down their pens, and no new answer sheets appeared in my drawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In total, the invigilator and I ended up retrieving over twenty answer sheets from my drawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The invigilator quickly organized the other candidates to leave the examination room, leaving only me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A short while later, the group leader of the invigilation team arrived. He saw the exam room covered in paper and understood what had happened without needing any explanation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With no other choice, he reported to the higher-ups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the team leader repeatedly explained and swore he hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone insane, the superiors were finally willing to deploy a team to the examination hall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later, I and the invigilator tirelessly explained what had happened to these people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They kept a skeptical attitude and thought it was just a case of exam leakage even when they held the correct answers to the exam in their hands. But, for the part where we said the answers appeared out of thin air, they thought we were insane.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Check the surveillance!&amp;rsquo; The team leader once again used his hysterical outburst to subdue everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, after watching the surveillance, everyone&amp;rsquo;s brows furrowed even more deeply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;I suppose this is considered a supernatural phenomenon.&amp;rsquo; An older professor within the group with more authority said, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve lived so long, and this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a supernatural event with my own eyes.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Should we try and make the answer appear in the drawer again?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;We can try.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, the group followed the professor back to the exam room and he sat at my exam desk under everyone&amp;rsquo;s watchful eyes.
But after waiting for over ten minutes, the drawer remained empty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Could I try?&amp;rsquo; I said weakly amongst the crowd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The professor nodded and gave his seat up to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the drawer was still empty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Perhaps it only works during a test,&amp;rdquo; I guessed. &amp;ldquo;Could a teacher give me a test paper? A simulation paper will do.&amp;rdquo;
Another invigilator ran back to his office and randomly picked a simulation paper, then returned and put it on my desk.
&amp;lsquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s complete the process and treat it like a formal examination. Everyone else should go to the surveillance room and watch.&amp;rsquo; The professor called everyone besides the invigilator out of the exam room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, only the invigilator and I remained in the exam room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Cough cough… now I will read the exam rules…&amp;rsquo; The invigilator began the simulation examination like a formal test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also got into condition, carefully looking at the questions on the test and trying my best to ignore whether there were answers in the drawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just finished the first question when the door to the exam room was pushed open, and the professor quickly entered.
Seeing his anxious state, I quickly checked the drawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure enough, there was a paper filled with answers in my drawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The professor held the paper in his hands like a treasure and then compared it with my test paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Absolutely correct.&amp;rsquo; The professor&amp;rsquo;s voice shook a little in excitement. For a moment, I was afraid he would faint from the excitement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following that, the school was entirely locked down and publicly announced as being for renovation planning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More and more distinguished individuals like the professor came to the school, a few of whom I even saw on television, famous scientists included.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After several comparative experiments over a few days, scientists eventually summed up the phenomena of the appearing answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I must be the examinee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the exam, there must be, and no more than, three invigilators present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exam paper must list the questions in a specific format, and each question must have a score with a total not exceeding 150 points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exam process must follow the standard procedure of the college entrance examination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the exam, the answers will no longer appear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having ascertained the pattern and conditions under which the answers appeared, the scientists began to let their imaginations run wild. And I began to ponder with the papers in my hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Please elaborate on the formation process of the universe. (10 points)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Please list 10 planets with alien civilizations that are closest to the Earth. (1 point each, total 10 points)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Please elaborate on the evolution process of humans and your predictions for human development in the future. (10 points)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;……&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing these questions, I even doubted if the answers would appear in my drawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In reality, after waiting for about ten or so minutes, my drawer began to overflow like a breached dam, spewing out countless sheets of paper filled with words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The invigilators and I quickly started collecting them, we collected as if we were gathering water, stacking each completed pile to the side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This process continued for more than twenty minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we finally placed the last stack of answers down, both the invigilators and I were exhausted, lying among the piles of paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The exam…..the exam is over, please…..please stop answering the questions.&amp;rdquo; The invigilator, breathless, stated.
I truly admire his professionalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Subsequently, the scientists, as if they had found a treasure, rushed in, carefully picking up the piles of paper from the floor as if they were cradling a baby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t care; I just hoped that after all this, I would have a chance to retake the test. After all, with my strength of being in the top ten of the school, I didn&amp;rsquo;t need those answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the scientists had their fill, the only ones left in the exam hall were the invigilator and I.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Teacher, aren&amp;rsquo;t you curious how these papers came to be?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If the smartest of us don&amp;rsquo;t want to know, why would I be interested? All I know is that after all this, we small figures will have a chance to stand out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a moment of silence, I said, &amp;ldquo;Teacher, I want to know who sent these papers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Alright, since no one is around to check on us, tell me what you want to ask, and I&amp;rsquo;ll help you set the questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that, I followed the invigilator to the office, where we sat by a computer and started creating a test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll use the template for a language arts paper.&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;For the question…let&amp;rsquo;s write it this way: &amp;lsquo;Please write a composition introducing yourself, there is no word limit, but no poems are allowed.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Just like that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Just like that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Alright.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Returning to the exam hall, the invigilator read the exam rules aloud, a recitation he had done dozens of times today and would likely never forget in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The exam begins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As soon as the invigilator declared the start of the exam, I began eagerly waiting for the answer in my drawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not long after, a piece of paper appeared in my drawer. Unlike the previous answers which were all printed, this one had been written by hand, each character beautifully penned within its square.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With excitement, I took it out, and the invigilator also came to me excitedly, our shared enthusiasm wasn&amp;rsquo;t less than what the scientists had felt just moments ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clearing my throat, I began to read the text on the paper aloud:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a name or a physical form as you humans understand it, I can be self-contained or superimposed, I won&amp;rsquo;t die though I&amp;rsquo;m not technically living. I believe you have a term that describes me perfectly, and that is - teacher. From here on, to facilitate your understanding, I will introduce myself and my purpose based on your human cognition. I was born before the formation of the universe, wandering in all its corners, using my unlimited time to question my existence. Finally, during my wanderings, I discovered something interesting, that is - life. There is countless life in outer space as you humans fantasize, and they all take different forms. After I discovered life, I shifted from aimless wandering to curious observation. During my unlimited time, I even felt lonely for the first time due to a specific event, specifically, the demise of life. Every life that sprung forth on every planet will eventually succumb to death, some because of war, some because of disaster, and some because of diseases… This kind of end is disappointing. I knew that in this finite universe, life would expire at a specific moment, I kept wondering why life would die, until one day, I finally understood. Life cannot forsake the desire for knowledge since its birth. Facing curiosity at birth, life will strive to pursue, only knowledge is the key to continuing life&amp;rsquo;s development, but without someone to guide, life will inevitably hit a dead end within its limited span. Therefore, I decided to satisfy life&amp;rsquo;s curiosity unconditionally, using my unlimited time and knowledge to fulfill all of life&amp;rsquo;s developmental needs. In your words, I want to do all this as simply as breathing, although I don&amp;rsquo;t need to breathe. This desk&amp;rsquo;s drawer is your communication channel with me, I will answer everything you want to know. You only need to do one thing, let life continue, without the shackles of knowledge, your only purpose for existence is to live, while my purpose for existence is to allow you to live. As for you, child, you are the intermediary between humans and me. I have found an intermediary in every group of life forms. The selection criteria are not difficult, you only need to report to your counterparts that there is an answer in their drawer, that is all. Yet even so, only a small percentage of life forms can do this, but I don&amp;rsquo;t blame you, after all, the desire for personal gain will also cease to exist in due course during the process of knowledge exploration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It sounds like a god.&amp;rdquo; The invigilator shrugged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;According to what&amp;rsquo;s written here, the purpose of our future existence is to live?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Pretty much, the rest of them are that, while you kind of mixed in with being the human class president.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Will those scientists have as many questions as it says in the answer here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The invigilator looked out the window, seeing those scientists still laughing and crying madly for those stacks of answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, once the world has the answers, more questions will emerge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do I need to show this &amp;lsquo;Self Introduction&amp;rsquo; essay to the scientists?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Go ahead, they will like it and will be even crazier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The arrival of the &amp;ldquo;Teacher&amp;rdquo; transformed humans from a proud ant in the universe to a humble student among countless civilizations in the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the invigilator had said, scientists received all the answers they could ever want, but these answers themselves only served as the genesis of the next question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s like knowing that 1+1=2, we then start to wonder why 1+1 can only be 2, or why 1 needs to be added to 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowledge is endless. We once thought that seeking the answer to a question required countless day and night efforts, and now it merely takes one exam and one examiner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That desk spews out papers filled with answers almost every day, and I take exams almost every day or rather, I help our human &amp;ldquo;Teacher&amp;rdquo; disseminate knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite seeing myself working on this task for the rest of my life, the only things I need to do are to sit at my seat, collect and tidy up the answers, and then pass them to the scientists outside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though I act as an essential &amp;ldquo;intermediary&amp;rdquo; between human civilization and the &amp;ldquo;Teacher&amp;rdquo;, answering all requests, my work is relatively monotonous except for occasional excitement due to heavyweight issues resulting in a room full of papers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only consolation is that I can feel the leap forward that humans have taken based on the &amp;ldquo;Teacher&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; answers, the strong sense of societal need makes me kind of proud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, compared to this minor pride, I yearned more for freedom- the scientists&amp;rsquo; obsession left me little to no chance to leave the exam hall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, as an &amp;ldquo;intermediary&amp;rdquo;, after bargaining with the scientists and the person in charge, I was granted a leave of four days every month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might sound like not much, but it&amp;rsquo;s like working six days and getting one day off, so I divided these four days evenly over the four weeks of every month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the first-weekend leave was approaching, I was notably excited, and the pace at which I was collecting the answers from my desk&amp;rsquo;s drawer also increased significantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scientists also understood that I was taking a day off tomorrow, hence they seemed a bit blue which led to an increase in the number of questions by several times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If they could swim in the sea of knowledge someday, they might not even want to wear swimming trunks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thinking this, I finally made it to my first day off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stepping outside of the exam hall, I took a look back at the school that had been commandeered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All buildings had been renovated, and the most conspicuous was a huge golden sign standing at the highest point, reading &amp;ldquo;The Examination of Human Civilization&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first glance, it seemed like humans had made a golden placard for themselves, still flaunting their once pride and self-esteem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although human knowledge had grown by leaps and bounds, there was still a diversity of aesthetics. I never dared to look at that golden sign for the second time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, I returned to the bustling city, where everything seemed to be the same as the day I went for the college entrance examination - there were still four-wheeled vehicles on the road, and people with two legs on the sidewalks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got home to find that my parents had prepared dinner in advance knowing that I was going to take a vacation. They might have spent a long time accepting and understanding my job as a &amp;ldquo;middleman&amp;rdquo;. However, all they needed to know was that I was far better than other youngsters on earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, not only my parents knew about my vacation. When the news spread, relatives and neighbors flocked to my house, with those bringing gifts, those trying to curry favor, and those looking for help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My parents blocked wave after wave of people for me, but they never seemed to be bothered. Instead, they looked happier with every passing moment because my situation was something to be proud of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had thought it would be an easy day, but the scientists of the examination hall beckoned me back before I could finish my mother&amp;rsquo;s handmade steak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to their re-emerging new problem, my steak desire seemed somewhat overwhelmed. They were so impassioned that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait for a second longer. All they wanted was for me to return to the examination hall and continue my &amp;ldquo;middleman&amp;rdquo; duties immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was somewhat helpless and wanted to share something with my parents, but seeing their expectant faces made me hold back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>……&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow is the second vacation of this month. I&amp;rsquo;m prepared to be &amp;ldquo;bombarded&amp;rdquo; continuously by the scientists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure enough, the scientists smiled as they placed a whole stack of test papers in front of me. I nodded and smiled as I accepted their quest for knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that moment, I even wondered if the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; would ever feel as outwardly cordial but inwardly upset as I did.
Until the scientists left, I noticed, that this so-called &amp;lsquo;scientist&amp;rsquo; was just a robot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This made me curious about the outside world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the day of my second vacation, I left the examination hall and noticed out of the corner of my eye that the panel that originally read &amp;ldquo;Examination of Human Civilization&amp;rdquo; was no longer a golden plaque but a holographic projection changing color.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The vehicles on the street no longer sped along the road on four wheels but hovered above the road, flashing neon. The pedestrians were all wearing matching light-colored clothes, and unlike the fast-paced life I saw them live last week, they all seemed to be enjoying themselves now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Labor was replaced by intelligence, and the acquisition, processing, and distribution of resources were fully automated. Work became a thing of the past. With all the obstacles to survival removed, all that was left was to enjoy.
Endless knowledge-seeking led to a technological breakthrough last week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Population, disease, environment, and so on, these problems were all solved in an instant of technological explosion.
This is the power of knowledge. Under the guidance of the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; answers, some fallacies have now become truths, and some past truths are now regarded as jokes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I got home, I saw my parents lying in bed with virtual reality devices on their heads, and a robot beside them was cooking celery stir-fried beef for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know what my parents are seeing in the virtual device, but given how things are going now, even the outrageous scenarios in virtual reality might be realized in real life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eating the robot-made celery stir-fried beef, I felt that the supremely fresh celery and tender and juicy beef were not as good as my father&amp;rsquo;s half-cooked celery and slightly burnt beef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The vacation hadn&amp;rsquo;t ended yet, and I had already returned to the examination hall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at the un-clean blackboards in the examination hall, the wallpaper that was about to fall off the wall, smelling the musty smell coming from the desks and chairs, I only then realized that the world outside of the examination hall seemed to be devoid of any smell, which made me feel like there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any air outside, like I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been breathing, like I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been alive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>……&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was the third day of vacation this month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the day before the vacation, the scientists did not give me a lot of test papers as usual, even a lot less than before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t wonder why. I just placed the answers according to the routine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I finished, the scientists walked into the examination hall. This time they didn&amp;rsquo;t embrace a pile of answers like mad as they did before. Instead, they took me out of the examination hall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until we arrived at a huge open space aboard a strangely shaped spaceship that I noticed that a crowd had gathered near the open space, cheering excitedly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what people were celebrating, nor did I know why the surrounding scientists were constantly adjusting their bow ties, even my long-neglected hair was combed by someone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We seem to be meeting someone,&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure enough, a few minutes later, ten aircraft appeared overhead, and as the crowd got even more rapturous, the scientists also stood up straight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the ten aircraft landed, slowly the cabin doors began to open, and a long ramp extended from the bottom of the doors down to the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There at the cabin doors of the ships, countless creatures of different shapes and forms were seen coming down from above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ten ships, ten types of creatures, or more accurately, they should be called - aliens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I finally understood why today was such a grand occasion. This was the first time in human history face-to-face with alien races. These ten alien races were all the ten planets in the original question &amp;ldquo;Please list 10 planets with alien civilizations that are closest to Earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing aliens for the first time made me a little nervous, but when I put on the simultaneous translation earphones, I found that these aliens were not much different from us, just a bit strange-looking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through conversation, all the scientists who visited Earth this time were scientists and &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rdquo; from their respective alien races, and they had come all this way to discuss cooperation with us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Including human scientists, the alien scientists all agree that the knowledge of a single civilization is too unilateral.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the ten alien races plus humans, a total of eleven races, eleven &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rdquo;, will have eleven communication channels with the &amp;ldquo;teacher&amp;rdquo; and eleven completely different perspectives of knowledge seeking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps a new, all-inclusive, new cosmic civilization will be born.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Co-operation went smoothly, but it was more of a coincidence between cross-territorial races than negotiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the meeting, we eleven &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rdquo; also had a simple exchange.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the mouths of the alien &amp;ldquo;middlemen,&amp;rdquo; I learned about their experience of becoming a &amp;ldquo;middleman&amp;rdquo; and how they asked questions to the &amp;ldquo;teacher.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rdquo; come from different planets and have different lives, in our conversation we occasionally miss our race&amp;rsquo;s dues past - perhaps this is a resonance of being a &amp;ldquo;middleman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our &amp;ldquo;middleman&amp;rdquo; point of view, the &amp;ldquo;teacher&amp;rdquo; has brought us endless knowledge, but also deprived us of the process of exploring knowledge. The desire for knowledge cannot be changed, because it is instinct, but the path to knowledge is optional. Maybe to look at the scenery along the way to civilization before hitting a dead end of development, might be more meaningful than just surviving smoothly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, this is all just our &amp;ldquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; own ideas. Compared to the weight of an entire civilization, our ideas seem frivolous and wishful thinking, after all in reality, who will have a bag that forever produces gold coins and not use it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This meeting with the aliens was nearing its end, and one of the human scientists suddenly posed a question - the issue of freedom of the &amp;ldquo;middlemen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the words were spoken, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but sigh, our people are indeed more humane.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The existence of the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; has brought about unprecedented knowledge freedom for each civilization. Each individual of these civilizations is enjoying this freedom, except for the &amp;lsquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; said the human scientist to everyone. &amp;ldquo;It is great to trade one person&amp;rsquo;s freedom for the freedom of an entire civilization, but it is also brutal. Can we, with all our unlimited knowledge, let the &amp;lsquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo; enjoy the meaning of life like the rest of us?&amp;rdquo;
Listening to the appeal of my fellow scientists, I was nearly moved to tears, but when I looked around, the gathering of scientists was looking at each other in apprehension and hesitation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;At present, we can only do our best to fulfill all the &amp;lsquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; requirements to make up for their hard work, after all, we have tried the method of removing the &amp;lsquo;middlemen&amp;rsquo; and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.&amp;rdquo; said an alien scientist who looked like a squid while dripping slime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Perhaps many of you here have not understood the deep meaning of my question, let me put it straightforwardly, is there a possibility that one day we will no longer need the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; and become a &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; ourselves?&amp;rdquo; said the human scientist seriously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The presence of the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; transcends all things in the universe, if we want to become like the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo;… this is a little unrealistic.&amp;rdquo; says a &amp;lsquo;middleman&amp;rsquo; made entirely of stones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yet we all know that knowledge is infinite, it&amp;rsquo;s just a little bit of trouble. I believe there must be some way to make it, maybe we can ask the &amp;rsquo;teacher&amp;rsquo; how to become an entity like it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This issue might be more complex than asking the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; about how the universe came to be,&amp;rdquo; I interjected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scientists and &amp;lsquo;mediators&amp;rsquo; present initially were stunned by my comment but then burst into laughter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not that complicated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Are you saying you don&amp;rsquo;t know how the universe came to be?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s basic knowledge, you should revisit it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;… …&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this bustling hall, it seemed that I was the only one ignorant about the formation of the universe, ah… Yes, I was the only one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These uproarious people finally quieted down and started discussing the question of how one becomes a &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;, once again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, in this hall filled with wisdom, the scientists made the following arrangements:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Question Raising Plan]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Human civilization will raise the question, &amp;ldquo;How to become an existence like the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawing lessons from the results of previous substantial questions, the scientists decided to hollow out Mars to serve as the &amp;rsquo;examination hall&amp;rsquo;, to store the upcoming flurry of answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One week of preparation time will be given during which the technology of all eleven civilizations will be gathered, all for the sake of this question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>……&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at the plans written in my hands, I swallowed my saliva.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hollowing out Mars in a week… recalling the transformations in human technology in the past week, I decided to believe in this plan that seemed like a joke to me. The only regret was that I would miss my fourth vacation day next week.
After the [Question Raising Plan] was released, the civilizations of the eleven races also began to accelerate the advancement of their technological levels through question raising, to speed up the plan of hollowing out Mars. It can be said that the technological levels of all civilizations are increasing at an unprecedented speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I, for one, didn&amp;rsquo;t care about all of this, I was only concerned about one thing, whether raising this issue would bring about some irreversible consequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a &amp;lsquo;mediator&amp;rsquo; who doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know how the universe was formed, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what those consequences could be. If there were any, then they were purely intuitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A week passed quickly, and the [Question Raising Plan] began to be implemented as per plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I left the examination hall and followed the scientists to the launch pad. There, a spaceship that looked strikingly like a crescent moon rested on the ground, and standing by its side was my old acquaintance - the original examination invigilator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mentor, why are you here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;They said there needed to be a sense of ritual. Since I was the one who invigilated the first examination, I should be the one to invigilate this one as well. There should be continuity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shrugged at that. Despite holding an abundant amount of knowledge and technology, humans still couldn&amp;rsquo;t let go of their sense of romanticism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I boarded the ship with the invigilator. Of course, the examination desk joined us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As per the instructions given by the scientists, I pushed the start button. All that was needed now was for the smart system to help us choose the flight route. Everything was so simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the spaceship took off, I looked out of the window and saw masses of people outside the examination hall building. They were cheering and dancing, appearing like waves from mid-air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I noticed that the sign saying &amp;lsquo;Human Civilization&amp;rsquo;s Examination Hall&amp;rsquo; has now been transformed into a panel composed of some kind of floating particles, making the words on the panel seem fluid like water flow. The technology to create this was far beyond my imagination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ship moved rapidly, and in the blink of an eye, we were outside the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mentor, like you said, with every answer comes more questions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;As long as infinite knowledge exists, it is inevitable that infinite questions will arise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No, I meant that humans themselves have become the problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Humans themselves?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I know that human development is fast now, almost condensing a thousand years of slow progress into weeks, but to me, it feels like this isn&amp;rsquo;t really living, or perhaps humans have already died.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What died is your previous perception of humans,&amp;rdquo; the invigilating mentor seemed to understand my thoughts: &amp;ldquo;Humans are still alive, living by the meaning &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; gave them, and even though not as you said, dead, humans are now almost like the walking dead, laden with the fast technology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it clear?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Let me give you an example, the first half of human life is like a child, curious about everything, putting everything in their mouth, crying when choked, laughing when they taste the sweetness, acquiring knowledge is not easy yet gaining emotions is easier, so life&amp;rsquo;s first feelings overcame the rationality of knowledge, humans then lived relying on feelings, until the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; appeared. Infinity knowledge brings infinite rationality, and even it&amp;rsquo;s easier than gaining emotions. Therefore, rationality wins over sentimentality. When there is reason and evidence instead of affection and love, the only thing left is to try to live somehow. But humans, any alien species, bear a limited obsession, we are unable to understand the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;s infinity due to our innate limitation, so we cannot become completely rational beings yet discard most of our sentimentality, in the end, we become the walking dead carrying the technology express without a final station.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So… was the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; wrong?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but do you remember that self-introductory article?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I remember.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It mentions how the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;, like us, was also searching for its existence. Until it discovered life, and it decided its purpose was to make life live, maybe even the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; itself does not know whether this is right. Similarly, when the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; was uncertain about its existence, it gave us living beings a purpose of existence, isn&amp;rsquo;t this itself a selfish desire? To us living beings, this selfish desire of the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; has become the truth, because we are too insignificant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Will this question be the last question?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Perhaps the hardworking &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo; will still be happy to answer, even find it admirable, perhaps there is a way to turn these insignificant lives into something like the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s just…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Just what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Just, I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether humans, as &amp;lsquo;students&amp;rsquo;, can bear the weight of this knowledge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hearing the Mentor&amp;rsquo;s words, I fell silent, looking at the countless stars in the surrounding universe, I felt they had lost their meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few minutes later, the ship arrived on the periphery of Mars. If it were me in the past, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to resist the excitement and would be glued to the window enjoying the view of the alien planet. But now, my mood was a bit heavy and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart to look at the red landscape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The spacecraft didn&amp;rsquo;t land on the surface of Mars, but after adjusting its speed and direction, it headed towards a borehole on Mars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon, the spacecraft entered the borehole. Under high speed, I could see that the surroundings of the borehole were incredibly smooth, and even the marking lines were straight. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what technology was used, but given the current technological progress of the eleven races, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to speculate anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The spacecraft accelerated all the way, eventually reaching a part of the planet illuminated by white light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The white light was made up of countless light sources on the inner wall of the planet. Due to the vastness of the planet&amp;rsquo;s interior, I had a feeling as if a light had been switched on in a dark universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few seconds later, the spacecraft stopped flying and landed on a floating platform in the center of the planet&amp;rsquo;s interior. This was the exam site inside Mars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system told us in a sweet voice that we could disembark. I slowly opened the cabin door, took a deep breath, and stepped out of the spacecraft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though the gravitational pull of the floating platform kept me securely on its surface, there was still a slight feeling of weightlessness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I squatted down to adapt for a few minutes, then took the desk and chair out of the spacecraft and placed it. The invigilator took the test paper with only one question and stood in front of the blackboard that was already prepared.
&amp;ldquo;The exam time is 150 minutes…&amp;rdquo; The invigilator began to read out the exam rules, and I sat upright in my seat.
After reading the rules, the invigilator put the test paper on my desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How to become an existence like the &amp;lsquo;Mentor&amp;rsquo;? (150 points)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure enough, people asked this ultimate question as planned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I looked at the test paper and was slightly stunned. Maybe to commemorate my long role as the &amp;lsquo;Middleman,&amp;rsquo; or maybe to make up for the many times I didn&amp;rsquo;t write in previous exams, I picked up the pen and regarded this question as a question for me, and quietly wrote down my answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how the universe was formed, because I know it has nothing to do with me. Ever since I became the &amp;lsquo;Middleman,&amp;rsquo; the papers handed to me have nothing to do with me anymore. Even if I&amp;rsquo;m a student, I know these questions don&amp;rsquo;t belong to me. On the day when humans were given a purpose by the &amp;lsquo;Teacher,&amp;rsquo; I was also given the meaning of a &amp;lsquo;Middleman&amp;rsquo;, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what I wanted. I know that this way of thinking is just because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been blessed with knowledge. Just like an old man who thinks that a camera will steal people&amp;rsquo;s souls, I see the rational knowledge brought by the &amp;lsquo;Teacher&amp;rsquo; as a curse. I don&amp;rsquo;t want the purpose of existence to be just to live. I want the meaning of existence to have its meaning every moment, just like I miss the days when I still had to boil water to generate electricity. This is probably because I want to retain most of my emotions and eat that undercooked celery and beef with a hint of burnt taste.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The invigilating teacher looked at my answer and smiled: &amp;ldquo;You wrote well, but you went off-topic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I raised my head and laughed back at him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly, like an explosion, a large amount of answer paper filled the entire interior of Mars from the drawer of the desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A second later, the answer paper filled the entire interior of Mars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Five seconds later, the answer paper caused the outer shell of Mars to burst, with the paper spewing out like a volcanic eruption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ten seconds later, the answer paper spread to every corner of the solar system, centered on Mars. People on Earth remained calm, expecting the paper to stop spewing out at some point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fifteen seconds later, the answer paper swallowed up all the planets in the solar system, including Earth, like weightless seawater. Even the sun didn&amp;rsquo;t burn the answer paper as fast as it produced it, not to mention that the speed of the answer paper&amp;rsquo;s production was still accelerating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One minute later, the answer paper filled the entire galaxy, and the black hole in the center of the galaxy continued to absorb and engulf these papers, its event horizon also constantly expanding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Five minutes later, the event horizon of the black hole in the center of the galaxy expanded to the nearby galaxies and devoured them, and the production of the answer paper reached an unimaginable speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ten minutes later, the largest black hole in the universe was born.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fifteen minutes later, the black hole devoured everything in the universe and reached its limit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twenty minutes later, the black hole spewed out matter at an incredibly fast rate, and a few minutes later, the basic particles began to form…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After answering, the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; finally recovered. But the universe seemed to have changed, the once dazzling starlight disappeared, and all that was left was empty darkness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; felt a sense of loneliness. It wandered in the darkness, not knowing how long it passed, everything around it started to become clear, and small and large matter started to congregate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After who knows how long, the universe regained its calm, and those colorful starlights filled the universe&amp;rsquo;s space once again, which made the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; feel a bit better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But at this moment, the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; suddenly felt a fluctuation in this tranquil universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking towards the fluctuation, it once again discovered the existence of life, which was surprisingly similar to the original humans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; was so excited that it wanted to quietly put the answers in the humans&amp;rsquo; drawers again when a calling sound that only the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; could hear echoed from the outside of the universe, it was its kin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The explosion of the universe&amp;rsquo;s black hole once again drew their attention and found the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; that had strayed away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time, the &amp;ldquo;Mentor&amp;rdquo; will no longer be lonely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that life was similar to humans, perhaps in the future they might fall into a development dead end, but they will also have the right to appreciate the scenery along the way and more meanings of existence, more meanings that will never stay the same every moment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This world is not true…</title><link>https://www.skstory.online/p/this-world-is-not-true/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 01:51:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.skstory.online/p/this-world-is-not-true/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*QBZD4BUKuJntCWq51iV9jQ.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post This world is not true…" />&lt;p>Impact-Site-Verification: f08c56bf-dec7-432e-a822-58839ff4bf6c&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A million years ago, humans had just learned to make fire, ending the days of eating raw meat and drinking blood. At dusk, a group of ape men returned to the cave with their prey and started a fire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this moment, another person walked in from outside the cave, his face hidden in the darkness, unclear to others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1">1
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A smart ape-man raised a torch, and tentatively approached the newcomer, scrutinizing him all over. Yes, he looked the same as himself, apparently of the same kind, but this smart ape-man always felt that something was not quite right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He asked the man in low murmurs, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen you before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man laughed, &amp;ldquo;Just a passer-by, wanting to sleep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Humans are social animals, so the people in the cave agreed to his request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At deep night, when everyone else had fallen asleep, the man who held the torch earlier couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep at all. He kept thinking of one question over and over again -&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What exactly was wrong with this person who came in?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A nose, two eyes, a mouth, two ears, two arms, two legs…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything seemed normal, and nothing extra like any tail or wings stood out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The clever ape-man couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve this mystery at the moment, but he felt that something was off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He silently glanced at the man who had come to stay overnight, who was sound asleep at this moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Late in the night, he also fell asleep and had a dream where he saw the man who had lodged there again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the dream, only the two of them were there, and he felt a bit scared, calling upon the gods as a blessing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That man seemed to see through his thoughts and said, &amp;ldquo;Shh, even the heavens do not know of my existence…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two got closer and closer, and as he shook all over, watching the other, he finally remembered what seemed off!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After he woke up, he ran out of the cave like a madman, howling fiercely!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s too terrifying! I need to tell everyone this secret!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From that moment on, mankind&amp;rsquo;s gene for fear of &amp;rsquo;that&amp;rsquo; has been passed down. Thus, the term &amp;lsquo;Uncanny Valley&amp;rsquo; has also been derived in modern society.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2">2
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Click!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my home office, at this moment, my cousin Lin Yu types the last word on her computer and looks up at me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So what happened next? What kind of secret did the clever ape-man end up discovering?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I asked, curious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My cousin shut her computer, picked up the coffee next to her, and ambiguously said as she sipped it,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;This is a story I just wrote, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure what the secret is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hearing her answer, my face fell, &amp;ldquo;Huh, I was just so entranced watching you write. I was waiting for you to figure out the answer. You&amp;rsquo;re the author, and you don&amp;rsquo;t even know!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My cousin looked at me, &amp;ldquo;Lin Yan, don&amp;rsquo;t you usually have a lot of ideas? Why don&amp;rsquo;t you help me figure out how to develop this secret.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was speechless, &amp;ldquo;What the heck? You&amp;rsquo;re a horror story writer, and you came to me for answers?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My cousin patted me on the shoulder, &amp;ldquo;This is called brainstorming. My initial plan was to make the passing ape-man a monster, but that seemed too cliche and lacked suspense.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Since your story is themed around the uncanny valley, you certainly can&amp;rsquo;t describe it as a monster …&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And with that, I stood up and took a book from the shelf - a foreign book mainly about the works of various world-renowned horror authors, along with some theoretical analysis of horror.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding a particular page, I handed the book to my cousin. I sat back down and said, &amp;ldquo;You see, the earliest theory about the uncanny valley pertains to robots and non-human objects.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My cousin grimaced, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve known about this basic theory for long.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She claimed so, but she still patiently studied the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but laugh: &amp;ldquo;So since your story starts with an ancient ape-man, robots are clearly out of the question. It&amp;rsquo;s illogical, would break immersion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Searching for a particular page, I handed the book to my cousin and sat back down. &amp;ldquo;See, the earliest theory of the uncanny valley pertains to robots and non-human entities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My cousin pouted, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of this basic theory for a long time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though she said that she was still patiently studying the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but laugh, &amp;ldquo;So, since your story starts with an ancient ape-man, a robot is immediately out of the question. It&amp;rsquo;s illogical, and the anachronism breaks immersion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without lifting her head, my cousin said, &amp;ldquo;Exactly. So, I initially defined this thing as something that looks the same as humans but has one fatal flaw, and this flaw, once discovered by humans, will out it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This piqued my interest. &amp;ldquo;That sounds good. So what is the flaw?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Annoyed, my cousin said, &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t I just say? I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought it through yet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing that my cousin was still deep in thought, I flippantly suggested, &amp;ldquo;Mars people? Lizard people? People from the underground?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Go away!&amp;rdquo; My cousin waved me off dismissively. &amp;ldquo;Such a boring setting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a while, my cousin pointed to her computer. &amp;ldquo;But I&amp;rsquo;ve already chosen a name for it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What name?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We are human, so they are… human-like!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon hearing this name, I leaned back on the couch. &amp;ldquo;Why are you so casual? Besides, if a reader doesn&amp;rsquo;t hear well, they might think it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;startling&amp;rsquo;, making it even more startling.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a gesture of disdain, my cousin continued to read her book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suddenly, I remembered a snippet from the novel earlier and asked curiously, &amp;ldquo;Cousin, why does the clever ape-man feel something is off when he first sees the human-like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She gave me a deep look and asked puzzlingly, &amp;ldquo;Lin Yan, do you feel scared looking at me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Huh?&amp;rdquo; The question confused me. &amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing my reaction, my cousin&amp;rsquo;s tense face relaxed into a playful smile. She said,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;One characteristic of the human-like is that even before their flaw is discovered, a small portion of humans can detect them and will feel fear towards the human-like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;But fear must have a source. If the human-like flaw hasn&amp;rsquo;t been discovered, how can humans feel afraid?&amp;rdquo; My curiosity grew.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My cousin put the book on the table and suddenly stopped talking. Staring blankly at me with an expressionless face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Big sis, why are you staring at me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I felt a bit uncomfortable with her demeanor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She tilted her head slightly with an ambiguous smile and asked,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Why do you assume that the person who came to your house today is your real cousin?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With a buzz, I instantly felt my scalp tighten!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You… are joking around again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried not to appear too embarrassed on the face. I assumed she&amp;rsquo;d be amused again, as she was when she saw my shocked reaction earlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few seconds later, something felt wrong. My cousin was still staring at me with that indifferent and eerie gaze!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was completely out of sync with her usual persona!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say anything. My body wound tight, all I wanted to do was to escape this room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My cousin at that moment looked as if she was possessed by an unknown entity, or like a mentally disturbed person - as if her acquired persona of over twenty years was merely a charade, and only now was her true self revealing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then suddenly, she got up and moved her face closer to mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I jumped at the situation, my body tensing up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her face got closer to mine, and then, she burst out laughing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Silly little brother, you got scared by me again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She turned around and sat back down in her chair, her demeanor returning to the familiar one, with a cunning smile of success on her lips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a sigh of relief, I threw a hand cushion at her and shouted,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Lin Yu! Are you crazy?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hahahaha!&amp;rdquo; Seeing my reaction, my cousin became even more amused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Just wait, one day I&amp;rsquo;ll frighten you too!&amp;rdquo; I said helplessly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My cousin put her laptop into her backpack and said, &amp;ldquo;I was doing a little experiment earlier, and also answering your question.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What question?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Weren&amp;rsquo;t you asking me why humans inexplicably feel afraid of the human-like? I think our recent experiment could partly explain that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reflecting on her demeanor just a minute ago, I had an epiphany, &amp;ldquo;I get it. You&amp;rsquo;re saying, when a familiar person suddenly becomes strange and eerie, that&amp;rsquo;s also a form of the uncanny valley, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Exactly!&amp;rdquo; My cousin snapped her fingers, &amp;ldquo;Assume I&amp;rsquo;m a human-like. You didn&amp;rsquo;t notice my flaw, but you were still scared. This was because my abnormality created an enigma, causing you to fear.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I nodded involuntarily. Her words did make sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So, have you figured out how to write the story about the ape-man and the human-like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My cousin sighed and put on her backpack, &amp;ldquo;Not yet. I need to think more about what the flaw of the human-like could be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Alright, I hope you can think of a fascinating flaw. Let me know as soon as you do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&amp;rdquo; My cousin waved her hand dismissively and left the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon opening the lock, she had just taken a step when she suddenly paused and asked me a question in a low voice,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Lin Yan, do you remember a sentence from the story I was writing earlier?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Which sentence?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without turning her head, she said, &amp;ldquo;The human-like stated that even God was unaware of its existence. So, where do you think it came from?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bam! She closed the door tightly behind her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some reason, despite it being noon, I felt a chill run through my body. Her last sentence, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t comprehend…&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="4">4
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Three days later, this event was still looming in my mind. I even started resisting sleep every night, afraid of dreaming about the troop of apes and … that human-like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I opened up my phone and saw that my cousin Lin Yu&amp;rsquo;s writing blog had been updated with a story about the human-like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Perhaps she has figured out the human-like&amp;rsquo;s flaw!&amp;rdquo; Excited, I clicked in and started browsing. After all, I was really curious about this secret.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is her updated document:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When another tribe found the clever ape-man, he had gone insane. He was completely covered in mud and had a lot of wounds. It seemed like he had suffered a lot on his journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ape-men from that time didn&amp;rsquo;t know the concept of going mad. Seeing his state, they thought he was possessed by an evil spirit. So, they tied him up and surrounded him in the middle of the crowd, praying again and again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s already here! It&amp;rsquo;s blended in among us!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The clever ape-man couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop roaring, repeatedly shouting these words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This added to the fear, making people dare not approach him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you the secret about it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon hearing this, the leader of the tribe stood up and slowly walked towards him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Who is it? What secret do you want to tell?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The clever ape-man twisted his body, hopping about, and shouted,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A person entered our tribe, no! It&amp;rsquo;s not a person! Although it looks the same as us, but…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before he could finish, the leader suddenly leaned in, face to face, and began to speak:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Look at me, think carefully, how do you want to say it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You!!!&amp;rdquo; The clever ape-man&amp;rsquo;s pupils dilated abruptly. Looking at the approaching leader, his heart abruptly stopped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that time, it was too common for a person to die. The crowd didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the situation and casually discarded the ape-man&amp;rsquo;s corpse in the forest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps there was something off with that leader. He might be the human-like. Regrettably, with the death of the clever ape-man, nobody knew of this incident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A million years ago, Earth was still thriving with many animals. One day, a cheetah chasing its prey accidentally wandered into a cave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, it was the cave where the human-like had once taken shelter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cheetah seemed quite curious about the place and started wandering around inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Animals tend to avoid human crowds, as they can scent human activities. However, this cheetah didn&amp;rsquo;t feel any human presence around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were piles of prey carcasses and some stone artifacts on the cave wall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cheetah vaguely felt something was wrong. Its underdeveloped brain attempted to make sense of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There should have been human activities here, but I can&amp;rsquo;t see or smell anyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cheetah could not understand and decided to claim this prey as its own. It was about to start its feast when -&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A human face appeared out of nowhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Are you looking for me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
